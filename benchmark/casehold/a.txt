                    CaseHOLD is a multiple choice question answering task derived
                    from legal citations in judicial rulings. The citing context from the
                    judicial decision serves as the prompt for the question. The answer
                    choices are holding statements derived from citations following
                    text in a legal decision. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds
                    to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding
                    statements.

                    ### Task
                    You are an expert legal AI tasked with identifying the correct holding statement index that matches the citing prompt from the CaseHOLD dataset, based on five provided holding options.

                    ### Input
                    - Citing Prompt: Drapeau’s cohorts, the cohort would be a “victim” of making the bomb. Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb. Felony offenses that involve explosives qualify as “violent crimes” for purposes of enhancing the sentences of career offenders. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another. See United States v. Newman, 125 F.3d 863 (10th Cir.1997) (unpublished) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Dodge, 846 F.Supp. 181,
                    - Holding Options (indexed 0 to 4):
                    0. holding that possession of a pipe bomb is a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 3142f1
                    1. holding that bank robbery by force and violence or intimidation under 18 usc  2113a is a crime of violence
                    2. holding that sexual assault of a child qualified as crime of violence under 18 usc 16
                    3. holding for the purposes of 18 usc  924e that being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a violent felony as defined in 18 usc  924e2b
                    4. holding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16

                    ### Instructions
                    - Analyze the citing prompt and select the single holding statement index (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) that most accurately corresponds to it.
                    - Output **EXACTLY ONE NUMBER** (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) in the response section below. Do not include any text, punctuation, or additional characters (e.g., no "Answer:", no commas, no letters).
                    - If the correct match is unclear, choose the most relevant index based on legal context and similarity.
                    - Failure to comply will result in an invalid response.
