The company also recorded a reduction to cost of sales of $29554 and $16040 for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. We need to find the difference between these two values: $24708 - (-$29554) = $24708 + $29554 = $54262. This is the increase in cost of sales due to the change in inventory valuation method.

The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of about $275 million for various technical services programs due to lower volume driven by the continuing impact of defense budget reductions and related competitive pressures.

However, these numbers are not directly comparable to the lease obligations. The correct approach is to look at the future minimum lease obligations, which were $2.3 billion at December 31, 2006. We can then subtract the 2011 value from this number to find the drop. According to the table, payments due by period (1) for 2011 was $158 million.

    "reasoning": "The question asks for the net three year avg derivative liability exposure in billions for 2016. The relevant data is found in the table: 'derivative receivables'. The column for 'equity' shows a value of $4939 million for 2015, but this is not what we need. Instead, we look at the 'total net of all collateral' which is $41373 million for 2016 and $43097 million for 2015. However, since the question asks about liability exposure, we should consider the opposite of receivables, i.e., liabilities. The table shows that the total derivative liabilities (net of cash collateral) were $59677 million in 2015, but this is not what we need either. We need to find the three year avg derivative liability exposure for 2016. Looking at the 'total net of all collateral' column again, we see that it was $41373 million for 2016. However, since this value includes both liabilities and assets, we should subtract it from the total derivative receivables (which is not directly provided) to find the liability exposure. Fortunately, the table also shows the 'liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables' which is -$22705 million for 2016. This means that the net derivative liabilities are $64078 million - (-$22705 million) = $86783 million. However, this value includes both liabilities and assets. To find the three year avg derivative liability exposure, we need to subtract the 'liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables' from the total derivative liabilities (which is not directly provided). Fortunately, the table also shows that the net derivative liabilities were $59677 million in 2015. Since we are looking for the three year avg derivative liability exposure for 2016, we can use the same ratio as in 2015: ($59677 million) / ($64078 million) = (0.933).

The question asks for the percent of the total long-term debt obligations in 2007. In the financial data, we can see that at December 31, 2005, the company's long-term debt obligations totaled $4.0 billion. We also know that the decrease in the long-term debt obligations as compared to December 31, 2004, was due to the redemptions and repurchases of $1.0 billion principal amount of outstanding securities during 2005. However, we are interested in 2007. In 2006, the payments due by period (1) for long-term debt obligations were $119 million. In 2007, the payments due by period (1) for long-term debt obligations were $1222 million. To find the percent of the total long-term debt obligations in 2007, we need to calculate the ratio of the payments due by period (1) in 2007 to the total long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2005. The total long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2005 were $4.0 billion. Now, let's perform the calculation step by step: First, we need to calculate the ratio of the payments due by period (1) in 2007 to the total long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2005. This can be calculated as follows: ($1222 million / $4.0 billion) = 0.3055. Now that we have the ratio, we can calculate the percent of the total long-term debt obligations in 2007 by multiplying the ratio by 100. The calculation is as follows: (0.3055 * 100) = 30.55%.

Now we can perform the calculation step by step: First, let's find the total offsetting factors: $55 million + $290 million = $345 million. Then, we'll divide the increasing factor by the total offsetting factors to get the ratio: $2,200,000,000 / $345,000,000 = 6.37. Now, we can calculate the percentage of the increasing factor compared to the total net sales in 2016: ($2,200,000,000 / $17,769,000,000) * 100 = 12.4%.

According to the data, the total principal payments are $8846, and the debt issuance costs net of accumulated amortization is -$53 million. The total long-term debt is $8793. We can subtract the debt issuance costs from the total long-term debt to get the actual amount of debt: $8793 - $53 = $8740. Then, we need to find the amount due after 2022. According to the data, the maturities are: 2018: $1045, 2019: $44, 2020: $1157, 2021: $1546, 2022: $705, and thereafter: $4349. The sum of these amounts is $8846, which is equal to the total principal payments. Therefore, we can conclude that all debt is due after 2022. To find the percentage, we divide the amount due after 2022 ($4349) by the total long-term debt ($8793), and multiply by 100: ($4349 / $8793) * 100 = 49.4",

According to note 16, the short-term debt consisted of drafts payable of $257 million and notes payable of $24 million. We also know that maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2013 were $300 million. Since we don't have information on the exact composition of these amounts, we will assume they are part of the total short-term debt. The total short-term debt is $257m + $24m = $281m.

    "predicted_answer": "70.6",
    "reasoning": "To find the portion of the company's property located in the United States, we need to calculate the total square feet of properties owned and leased in the US. According to the financial data, the total square feet of properties owned in the US is 3964 (thousands) and the total square feet of properties leased in the US is 845 (thousands). We can add these two numbers together to get the total square feet of properties located in the US: 3964 + 845 = 4819. Then, we need to divide this number by the total square feet of all properties owned and leased in the US, which is 4809 + 1998 = 6807. Finally, we can calculate the portion of the company's property located in the United States as follows: (4819 / 6807) * 100 = 70.6%",
