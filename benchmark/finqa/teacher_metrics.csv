Next, we need to calculate the cumulative total return for each year by subtracting the previous year's closing price from the current year's closing price and then dividing by the previous year's closing price. Here are the calculations:

12/02: $100.00 (no change)
12/03: $260.29 - $100.00 = $160.29 / $100.00 = 1.60

First, we need to find the total number of rdus vested during the three-year period. According to the financial data, 28500 rdus were outstanding as of December 31, 2014. However, the rdus vested daily on a pro rata basis over the three-year period from January 1, 2012, so we need to calculate the total number of rdus vested during the three-year period. To do this, we can use the fact that there were 365 days in the three-year period (365 x 3 = 1095). Therefore, the total number of rdus vested during the three-year period is: 28500 x (1095/365) = 28500 x 3 = 85500. Now we need to divide the total number of rdus vested by the number of years the rdus were vested to get the average vesting per year. There were three years during which the rdus were vested (2012, 2013, and 2014), so we can divide 85500 by 3 to get the average vesting per year: 85500 / 3 = 28500.
