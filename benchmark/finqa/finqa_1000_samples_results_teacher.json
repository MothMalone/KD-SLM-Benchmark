Therefore, we can assume that the increase in inventories at FIFO net is not entirely due to an increase in costs, but rather a result of increased sales volume. Based on this assumption, we can estimate that the increase in inventories at FIFO net had a positive impact on cash flow from operations, as the company was able to generate more revenue from the increased sales volume.

First, we need to calculate the percentage increase in volume: 4.5% = 0.045 (round to two decimal places). Next, we need to multiply the percentage increase by the total billed electricity usage to get the variance in volume: 721 gwh x 0.045 = 31.97 gwh. Finally, we can divide the variance in volume by the total billed electricity usage to get the average price per gwh: 31.97 gwh / 721 gwh = 0.044 or 4.4%. Therefore, the answer is 4.4%.",

However, the rdus vested daily on a pro rata basis over the three-year period from January 1, 2012, so we need to calculate the total number of rdus vested during the three-year period.

Therefore, the total number of rdus vested during the three-year period is: 28500 x (1095/365) = 28500 x 3 = 85500. Now we need to divide the total number of rdus vested by the number of years the rdus were vested to get the average vesting per year. There were three years during which the rdus were vested (2012, 2013, and 2014), so we can divide 85500 by 3 to get the average vesting per year: 85500 / 3 = 28500.

From the data, we can see that the 2007 balance is $9,643,000, and the prior period balance is $8,513,000. To calculate the percentage increase, we can use the following formula: (($9,643,000 - $8,513,000) / $8,513,000) x 100. This gives us: ($9,643,000 - $8,513,000) = $1,129,000, ($1,129,000 / $8,513,000) x 100 = 132.8%. Therefore, the answer is 132.8%.",

    "reasoning": "To calculate the future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases for the years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010, we need to extract the relevant information from the provided financial data. First, we see that the total future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2008, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is given as follows: \n$1792000 in 2009, $1732000 in 2010, $1576000 in 2011, $1417000 in 2012, and $1300000 in 2013, with a total of $7216000 thereafter. \nNext, we see that the percentage rents approximated $7322000, $9379000, and $7593000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. \nFinally, we see that we are due an aggregate of $30400000 as of December 31, 2008, from Stop & Shop, which is contesting our right to reallocate the additional rent. \nNow, to calculate the future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases for the years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010, we need to subtract the percentage rents from the total future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases. \nFor 2009, we have: $1792000 - $7322000 = $10598000. \nFor 2010, we have: $1732000 - $7593000 = $9428000. \nTherefore, the future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases for the years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010 are: $10598000 and $9428000, respectively.",

To calculate the percentage of home equity lines of credit in total commitments to extend credit and other commitments in 2018, we can use the following formula: ($16944 / $181612) x 100 = 0.093 or 9.3%.

To calculate the average variance, we need to find the standard deviations of the value at risk of each product for the year ended December 31, 2008. The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance. Therefore, we first need to calculate the variance of the value at risk of each product.

To calculate the variance, we need to find the actual and expected values of the value at risk of each product for the year ended December 31, 2008. The actual values are provided in the financial data, and the expected values can be calculated using the historical simulation method.

    "reasoning": "To find the percent of total future minimum lease commitments and contingencies for operating leases that was due in 2009, we need to identify the specific numbers mentioned in the question and find them in the provided data. The question asks for the percentage of total future minimum lease commitments and contingencies that is due in 2009. The provided data states that the future minimum lease commitments and contingencies for operating leases at December 31, 2007 are as follows: years ending December 31: 2008 $42,335; 2009 $33,249; 2010 $25,149; 2011 $17,425; 2012 $11,750; thereafter $28,581. The total future minimum lease commitments and contingencies for operating leases at December 31, 2007 is $158,489. To find the percent of total future minimum lease commitments and contingencies that is due in 2009, we can divide the amount due in 2009 ($33,249) by the total future minimum lease commitments and contingencies for operating leases at December 31, 2007 ($158,489), and then multiply by 100: ($33,249 \u00f7 $158,489) x 100 = 20.6%.

However, we can use the information provided in the financial data to estimate the value of Kelway in the fourth quarter of 2014.

To calculate the approximate value of Kelway, we can use the formula: Total Assets - Total Liabilities = Equity Value. Using the financial data provided, we can calculate the total assets and total liabilities of the company as follows: Total Assets = Current Assets + Non-current Assets = $2,354.8 million + $1,067.9 million = $3,422.7 million. Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities + Non-current Liabilities = $1,203.3 million + $452.5 million = $1,655.8 million. Therefore, Equity Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities = $3,422.7 million - $1,655.8 million = $1,766.9 million.

The question asks for the percentage of total operating revenues that was associated with other revenues in 2008. Based on the financial data provided, we can see that other revenues in 2008 were $852 million. To calculate the percentage, we need to divide the amount of other revenues by the total operating revenues and multiply by 100. Total operating revenues in 2008 were $17970 million. So, we can calculate the percentage as follows: (($852 million / $17970 million) x 100) = 4.76%. Therefore, the answer is 4.76%.",

The specific numbers mentioned in the question are: 'next 36 months' which is mentioned as 'within the next 36 months' in the provided data. Therefore, we need to find the portion of total long-term borrowings that is due within the next 36 months. According to the provided data, the total long-term borrowings are $41932 million. To find the portion of total long-term borrowings that is due within the next 36 months, we need to identify the portion of the total long-term borrowings that will be due within the next 36 months. The provided data states that the 2015 notes and 2022 notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the company at a make-whole redemption price.

The total compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 through 2017 was $66.0 million, $59.8 million, and $43.3 million, respectively. Of this amount, $2.5 million, $2.4 million, and $2.5 million, respectively, related to stock-based payments. Non-executive directors received an annual award of class A common stock with a value equal to $100,000. They may also elect to receive some or all of the cash portion of their annual stipend, up to $60,000, in shares of stock based on the closing price at the date of distribution.

These shares are not subject to any vesting restrictions. To calculate the compensation expense attributable to directors, we need to subtract the amount of stock-based payments from the total compensation expense for each year.
