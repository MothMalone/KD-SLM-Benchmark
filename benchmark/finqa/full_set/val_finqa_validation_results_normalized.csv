To find out how much higher is the fair value than carrying value, we need to subtract the carrying value from the fair value. Here are the calculations step by step: 2012 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 1,137 million - $ 1,050 million = $ 87 million higher. 2013 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 1,327 million - $ 1,250 million = $ 77 million higher. 2014 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 1,507 million - $ 1,450 million = $ 57 million higher. 2019 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 2,200 million - $ 2,000 million = $ 200 million higher. Therefore, the fair value is higher than the carrying value by the following amounts: $ 87 million for 2012 notes, $ 77 million for 2013 notes, $ 57 million for 2014 notes, and $ 200 million for 2019 notes. Finally, we add all these amounts to get the total higher fair value than carrying value, which is: $ 87 million + $ 77 million + $ 57 million + $ 200 million = $ 421 million higher.

We are asked to find the average variance of the value at risk of each 2008 section. To do this, we need to calculate the variance of the value at risk for each section and then find the average of those variances. First, we need to identify the specific numbers mentioned in the question. The question mentions the following numbers: $1.8, $4.7, $0.3, $1.4, $3.7, and $0.7. These are the values for foreign exchange products, interest-rate products, and asset and liability management activities for the year 2008. Next, we need to calculate the variance of the value at risk for each section. To do this, we need to subtract the minimum value from each maximum value and then divide by the number of observations. For foreign exchange products, the maximum value is $4.7, the minimum value is $0.3, and there are 4 observations. So, the variance of the value at risk for foreign exchange products is: ($4.7 - $0.3) / 4 = $1.875. For interest-rate products, the maximum value is $3.7, the minimum value is $0.6, and there are 4 observations. So, the variance of the value at risk for interest-rate products is: ($3.7 - $0.6) / 4 = $2.375. For asset and liability management activities, the maximum value is $1.4, the minimum value is $0.7, and there are 4 observations. So, the variance of the value at risk for asset and liability management activities is: ($1.4 - $0.7) / 4 = $1.25. Now that we have calculated the variances of the value at risk for each section, we need to find the average of those variances. To do this, we add up all the variances and divide by the number of observations. The sum of the variances is: $1.875 + $2.375 + $1.25 = $5.45. Dividing by the number of observations (4) gives us the average variance of the value at risk of each 2008 section: $5.45 / 4 = $1.3625. Therefore, the answer to the question is $1.3625.",False,"Numerical comparison: 3.85 vs 1.3625, equivalent=False",731

The specific numbers mentioned in the question are: $83382, $63060, $35269, $21598, and $14860. These are the future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year for each of the years in the five years ending December 31, 2012, and thereafter, in aggregate. Next, we need to find those exact numbers in the provided data.

The previous total is 22203, so we have: (25603 - 22203) / 22203 = 15.2%. Therefore, the percentage change in common stock and option is 15.2%.","To calculate the percentage change in common stock and option, we need to first identify the specific numbers mentioned in the question. The question asks for the percentage change in common stock and option, so we need to find the relevant numbers in the provided data. The data provides information about the common stock and option under various plans, but the question only requires the percentage change in common stock and option. Therefore, we can disregard the information about the other plans and focus on the common stock and option under the vertex purchase plan and the vertex 401(k) plan. The relevant numbers mentioned in the question are 21829, 249, and 125.

The question asks for the percentage of accrued casualty costs out of total accounts payable and other current liabilities at December 31, 2011. The financial data provided shows that accrued casualty costs were $249 million at December 31, 2011, while total accounts payable and other current liabilities were $3,108 million. To calculate the percentage, we divide the amount of accrued casualty costs by the total accounts payable and other current liabilities and multiply by 100: ($249 million / $3,108 million) x 100 = 7.9%.",True,"Numerical comparison: 0.08 vs 0.079, equivalent=True",869
UNP/2007/page_65.pdf-3,what percentage of total debt is due after 2012?,61%,9.5%,"To find the percentage of total debt that is due after 2012, we need to calculate the amount of debt due after 2012 and divide it by the total debt. First, we can identify the debt maturities for each year from the provided data: $689 million in 2008, $542 million in 2009, $462 million in 2010, $550 million in 2011, $720 million in 2012, and $4717 million thereafter. We can then calculate the total debt as the sum of all these maturities: $689 + $542 + $462 + $550 + $720 + $4717 = $7680 million. Finally, we can divide the amount of debt due after 2012 ($720 million) by the total debt ($7680 million) to get the percentage: $720 / $7680 = 0.095 or 9.5%.",False,"Numerical comparison: 0.61 vs 0.095, equivalent=False",870
