The question asks for the annual other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007. To do this, we need to find the following numbers: annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007. These numbers can be found in the financial data provided above. Based on the data, the annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) in 2007 is $475,288, and the annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007 is $30,200,000. To calculate the percentage of annual other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations), we can divide the annual other sinking fund requirements by the annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and multiply by 100. Based on the data, the annual other sinking fund requirements in 2007 is $30,200,000 / $475,288 = 64.05% or 64.05/100 = 64.05%. To calculate the annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007 as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations), we can divide the annual cash sinking fund requirements by the annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and multiply by 100.

Here are the calculations step by step: 2012 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 1,137 million - $ 1,050 million = $ 87 million higher. 2013 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 1,327 million - $ 1,250 million = $ 77 million higher. 2014 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 1,507 million - $ 1,450 million = $ 57 million higher. 2019 notes: fair value - carrying value = $ 2,200 million - $ 2,000 million = $ 200 million higher.

Finally, we add all these amounts to get the total higher fair value than carrying value, which is: $ 87 million + $ 77 million + $ 57 million + $ 200 million = $ 421 million higher.

The fair value of beginning assets is mentioned as $1,502,437,000, and the time period is mentioned as 'this time period'.

    "reasoning": "To calculate the average variance of the value at risk of each 2008 section, we need to first identify the specific numbers mentioned in the question. The question asks for the average variance of the value at risk of each 2008 section. The provided data gives us the following information: foreign exchange products, interest-rate products, and asset and liability management activities. We are asked to find the average variance of the value at risk of each 2008 section. To do this, we need to calculate the variance of the value at risk for each section and then find the average of those variances. First, we need to identify the specific numbers mentioned in the question. The question mentions the following numbers: $1.8, $4.7, $0.3, $1.4, $3.7, and $0.7. These are the values for foreign exchange products, interest-rate products, and asset and liability management activities for the year 2008. Next, we need to calculate the variance of the value at risk for each section. To do this, we need to subtract the minimum value from each maximum value and then divide by the number of observations. For foreign exchange products, the maximum value is $4.7, the minimum value is $0.3, and there are 4 observations. So, the variance of the value at risk for foreign exchange products is: ($4.7 - $0.3) / 4 = $1.875. For interest-rate products, the maximum value is $3.7, the minimum value is $0.6, and there are 4 observations. So, the variance of the value at risk for interest-rate products is: ($3.7 - $0.6) / 4 = $2.375. For asset and liability management activities, the maximum value is $1.4, the minimum value is $0.7, and there are 4 observations. So, the variance of the value at risk for asset and liability management activities is: ($1.4 - $0.7) / 4 = $1.25. Now that we have calculated the variances of the value at risk for each section, we need to find the average of those variances. To do this, we add up all the variances and divide by the number of observations. The sum of the variances is: $1.875 + $2.375 + $1.25 = $5.45. Dividing by the number of observations (4) gives us the average variance of the value at risk of each 2008 section: $5.45 / 4 = $1.3625. Therefore, the answer to the question is $1.3625.",

The data mentions the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans approved by security holders, which is 1442912. We can use this number to calculate the total value of the issued options, warrants, and rights. First, we need to find the exercise price of the outstanding options, warrants, and rights. The data mentions that the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is $86.98. Next, we can multiply the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans approved by security holders (1442912) by the weighted-average exercise price ($86.98) to get the total value of the issued options, warrants, and rights. Therefore, the total value of the issued options, warrants, and rights is: 1442912 x $86.98 = $123570192 million.",

To answer this question, we need to find the following numbers: rent expense in 2013, rent expense in 2012, certain office equipment expense in 2013, and certain office equipment expense in 2012.

Now we can perform the calculation step by step: first, we need to find the difference between rent expense in 2013 and rent expense in 2012, which is: rent expense in 2013 - rent expense in 2012 = $118,324 - $96,753 = $21,571.
