    "reasoning": "To calculate the expected growth rate in rent expense for operating leases in 2016, we need to analyze the given data. The total minimum future lease payments are $52083, and the rent expense for all operating leases amounted to $6.7 million, $3.3 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We can calculate the growth rate by comparing the rent expenses of consecutive years. The growth rate from 2014 to 2015 is ($6.7 - $3.3) / $3.3 = 102.0%. Now, we need to find the growth rate from 2015 to 2016. We can calculate it as (($6.7 + x) - $3.3) / ($6.7 + x), where x is the expected rent expense for 2016. However, since we are given the total minimum future lease payments, we can use that information to find the growth rate. The total minimum future lease payments for 2016 is $6678, which is an increase of $147 from 2015. We can calculate the growth rate as ($6678 - $52083) / $52083 = 0.129 or 12.9%. Therefore, the expected growth rate in rent expense for operating leases in 2016 is 12.9%.",

According to the data, the operating loss for connected fitness in 2015 was $61.3 million, which includes an acquisition contribution of $23.6 million. So, the operating loss for connected fitness in 2014 would be $61.3 - $23.6 = $37.7 million. The net revenues for connected fitness in 2014 were not explicitly stated, but we can find them by subtracting the operating income from the total net revenues of the segment. According to the data, the total net revenues for connected fitness in 2015 were $61301 (loss), which is likely an error and should be $13.1 million. Assuming this is correct, we can calculate the net revenues for connected fitness in 2014 as follows: $13.1 - ($37.7 - $23.6) = $-0.9 million. Now, we can calculate the operating margin by dividing the operating income by the net revenues and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage: (($37.7 - (-0.9)) / (-0.9)) * 100 = -3185.56%.

Assuming the correct value should be $13.1 million instead of $61301 (loss), we can recalculate the operating margin as follows: (($37.7 - (-0.9)) / 13.1) * 100 = 287.3%.",

We can see that this rating has an exposure net of all collateral of $6373 and a percentage of exposure net of all collateral of 16%. To find the percentage of ratings equivalent to junk bonds, we need to divide the number of junk bond ratings by the total number of ratings and multiply by 100. The total number of ratings is 100% (or 40415). We can see that there are 2 junk bond ratings (ccc+/caa1 and below) out of a total of 40415 ratings.

The question asks for the total decline in sales before the partial offsetting increase leading to the net decline in millions. According to the text, the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $450 million for air and missile defense programs (thaad and pac-3) due to increased production volume and deliveries; about $70 million for fire control programs due to net increased deliveries and volume; and approximately $55 million for tactical missile programs due to net increased deliveries. The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of about $275 million for various technical services programs due to lower volume driven by the continuing impact of defense budget reductions and related competitive pressures. Therefore, we need to subtract the partial offsetting increase from the total increase to find the decline in sales before the partial offsetting increase. The total increase is $450 + $70 + $55 = $575 million. The partial offsetting decrease is $275 million.

The total number of RDUs outstanding is 28,500, and they were vested daily on a pro rata basis over a 3-year period. We can calculate the total number of days in the 3-year period: 2012 (365) + 2013 (365) + 2014 (366) = 1096 days. Since RDUs vest daily, we multiply the total number of days by the daily vesting amount: 28,500 * 1096 / 3 = 9,780,000. Now, we can calculate the average RDUs vesting each year: 2012: (365/1096) * 9,780,000 \u2248 2,654,119; 2013: (365/1096) * 9,780,000 \u2248 2,743,919; 2014: (366/1096) * 9,780,000 \u2248 2,833,319. Now, we can calculate the average RDUs vesting each year by adding them up and dividing by 3: (2,654,119 + 2,743,919 + 2,833,319) / 3 = 8,232,176 / 3 \u2248 2,747,389.33",

    "reasoning": "To find the percent of the total long-term debt obligations in 2007, we need to first identify the specific numbers mentioned in the question. The question asks for the percent of the total long-term debt obligations in 2007. We can see from the table that the payments due by period (1) for long-term debt obligations in 2007 is $119 million. Next, we need to find the total long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2005. According to the text, the company's long-term debt obligations, including current maturities and unamortized discount and issue costs, totaled $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005. To calculate the percent of the total long-term debt obligations in 2007, we can divide the payments due by period (1) for long-term debt obligations in 2007 ($119 million) by the total long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2005 ($4.0 billion). This gives us a ratio of 119/4000 = 0.02975. To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100: 0.02975 x 100 = 2.975%. Therefore, the percent of the total long-term debt obligations in 2007 is 2.975%.",

Since both values ($45) are from intangibles, we can calculate the percentage as follows: ($45 + $45) / $90 * 100 = (2 * $45) / $90 * 100 = $90 / $90 * 100 = 1 * 100 = 100.

We subtract the cash consideration paid for outstanding stock-based awards ($19 million) from this amount: $4719 - $19 = $4700 million. This is the total amount funded by new borrowing.

We add these two amounts together: $4700 + $3464 = $8164 million. This is the total amount of the purchase price. Now, we subtract the amount funded by new borrowing from this total: $8164 - $4700 = $3464 million.

    "reasoning": "To find the portion of total future minimum lease payments due within the next 12 months, we need to calculate the present value of net minimum lease payments for the next 12 months. The given data states that the implicit rate is 7.45%. We can use this rate to calculate the present value of the next 12 months' lease payments. First, let's find the total future minimum lease payments for years after 2008: 366514 (in thousands). Since we want to find the portion due within the next 12 months, we will consider only the first year's payment, which is 31739 (in thousands). We can calculate the present value of this payment using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, FV is the future value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods. In this case, FV = 31739, r = 0.0745, and n = 1. Plugging in these values, we get PV = 31739 / (1 + 0.0745)^1 = 31739 / 1.0745 \u2248 29455. We can also calculate the present value of net minimum lease payments for years after 2008 using the same formula: PV = 366514 / (1 + 0.0745)^n, where n is the number of years after 2008. For n = 1, we get PV \u2248 262534. Now, let's calculate the total present value of net minimum lease payments for the next 12 months by adding the present values of the first year's payment and the present value of net minimum lease payments for years after 2008: 29455 + 262534 \u2248 269489. Finally, we can find the portion of the total future minimum lease payments due within the next 12 months by dividing the total present value by the total future minimum lease payments for years after 2008: 269489 / 366514 \u2248 0.732 or 73.2%.",

    "ground_truth": "28125000",
    "predicted_answer": "41136364",
    "reasoning": "The question asks for the expected annual cash interest costs for the 6.625% senior notes. According to the financial data, Ball issued $450 million of 6.625% senior notes due in March 2018. The effective yield to maturity is 6.65%. To calculate the annual cash interest cost, we need to multiply the principal amount by the annual interest rate. First, convert the percentage to a decimal: 6.65% = 0.0665. Then, multiply the principal amount ($450 million) by the annual interest rate (0.0665): $450,000,000 x 0.0665 = $30,075,000,000. However, this is not the cash interest cost. The cash interest cost is the interest paid during the year, which includes a redemption premium of $6.6 million in 2005. To find the annual cash interest cost, we need to subtract the redemption premium from the total interest paid: $30,075,000,000 - $6,600,000 = $29,769,400,000. However, this is not the correct answer because it includes a large amount of money that was paid in 2005. We should only consider the cash interest cost for the years after 2005. According to the financial data, Ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities on October 13, 2005, and redeemed its 7.75% senior notes during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. This means that the redemption premium was already accounted for in the total interest costs. Therefore, we can simply divide the principal amount by the number of years the note is outstanding: $450,000,000 / 11 years = $41,136,364 per year. However, this calculation does not take into account the fact that the note has a variable interest rate. To calculate the annual cash interest cost, we need to find the average annual interest rate. According to the financial data, Ball issued the senior notes on March 27, 2006, and they are due in March 2018. This means that the note is outstanding for approximately 11 years. However, the interest rate varies over time. To calculate the average annual interest rate, we can use the effective yield to maturity, which is 6.65%. We can also use the fact that Ball issued the senior notes at a price of 99.799% and they have an effective yield to maturity of 6.65%. This means that the average annual interest rate is approximately 6.65%. Now we can calculate the annual cash interest cost: $450,000,000 x 0.0665 = $30,075,000,000. However, this calculation does not take into account the fact that Ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities on October 13, 2005, and redeemed its 7.75% senior notes during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. This means that the redemption premium was already accounted for in the total interest costs. Therefore, we can simply divide the principal amount by the number of years the note is outstanding: $450,000,000 / 11 years = $41,136,364 per year. The correct answer is $41,136,364.",

Additionally, the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and tax refund claims in other revenues on the consolidated statements of income.

According to note 11, total income tax expense for 2006 was $1557 million and for 2005 was $639 million. Since we know the difference between the actual tax rates and the statutory rate, we can calculate the total revenue by adding the differences to the statutory rate multiplied by the respective years' revenues. For 2007, this would be ($1601 - $4) + ($35 * x), where x is the total revenue for 2007.

To find the percentage of future minimum lease payments due after 2019, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount due and the amount due before 2019, then divide by the total amount due. The difference is $301682 - $77089 = $224493. Then, we can calculate the percentage: ($224493 / $468218) * 100 = 48.0",
