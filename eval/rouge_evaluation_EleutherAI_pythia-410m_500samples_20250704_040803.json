I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.\n#Person2#: Sounds great to me! If they are willing, we could ask them to go dancing with us. That is excellent exercise and fun, too.\n#Person1#: Good. Let's go now.\n#Person2#: All right.",
    "#Person1#: Hi Tony, I feel so tired.\n#Person2#: Oh, I'm sorry, is there something wrong?\n#Person1#: Yes, Christmas is coming, and it seems everything has been going wrong lately.\n#Person2#: Here, sit down and tell me about it.\n#Person1#: Well recently, I've had to be at work by 8:00 AM. You know, I work in the toy department at the shopping center.\n#Person2#: Ah, yes, of course, it's much busier than usual. Everyone's shopping for Christmas presents.\n#Person1#: Yesterday I overslept and I was 10 minutes late. At 10:00 o'clock, the front doors of the shopping center open and a flood of shoppers walked into the toy department, soon people were shouting, pushing me around or making angry demands.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's awful.\n#Person1#: I'm used to it now, it's just that selling gifts for kids is such an unpleasant job before Christmas. Christmas doesn't mean much to me now, except more work and more headaches.",
    "#Person1#: The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn.\n#Person2#: Certainly, please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.\n#Person1#: What is this test for?\n#Person2#: Well, today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count.\n#Person1#: What does that tell him?\n#Person2#: Well, if it is elevated, you might have an infection.\n#Person1#: Will the blood test hurt?\n#Person2#: It is only a little pin stick. I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up.\n#Person1#: Ouch!\n#Person2#: There we go! I got the blood that I needed.",
    "#Person1#: May I help you, sir?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm looking for a nice gift for my mother. It's her birthday tomorrow.\n#Person1#: Do you have anything special in mind?\n#Person2#: No, not really.\n#Person1#: Perhaps she would like a necklace. We have many choices here.\n#Person2#: No, thanks. My mom doesn't like jewels.\n#Person1#: Well, then. Maybe a watch would be nice.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's it. She does need a new watch with big, clear numbers. She has complained a lot about the small numbers on her watch.\n#Person1#: This gold one is pretty, and I'm sure it will be easy for her to read the time.\n#Person2#: Don't you think it's a bit too fancy for old ladies?\n#Person1#: No, it actually sells very well and the old ladies like it very much.\n#Person2#: Maybe you are right. I'll take it.\n#Person1#: I'm sure your mother will love it.\n#Person2#: I hope so.",
    "#Person1#: Hey Welcome to Berlin, it's great to see you again.\n#Person2#: Yeah, good to see you too. Have you been waiting here at the station long?\n#Person1#: Only 15 minutes, but let's get out of this cold and go to my apartment. How are you feeling after that long bus ride?\n#Person2#: It wasn't too bad, it was only 19 hours.\n#Person1#: That's crazy. You could have flown here from London for 60 euros and it would have only taken an hour and a half. Was it really worth all that time just to save a bit of money.\n#Person2#: Well, it was a pretty uncomfortable right to be honest. The bus was starting to smell toward the end of it and there was a guy next to me, he was breathing really loudly while he was sleeping. But the reason I took the passwords because it's more environmentally friendly than flying.\n#Person1#: I think it's great that you want to help the environment, but you look so exhausted right now. I just think you should be a little more careful with your health.\n#Person2#: Well. I wasn't expecting the bus to be so unpleasant, but you're right. Next time I visit you, I'll probably fly.",
    "#Person1#: Harry, what's the matter? You look pale.\n#Person2#: I just had a terrible experience.\n#Person1#: Did you have an accident?\n#Person2#: Not quite, but almost. I was crossing the street just now and was almost hit by a car. Fortunately, I jumped back in time.\n#Person1#: How awful! I hope you got the number of the car, so you can report this man to the police.\n#Person2#: Before I realized what had happened, the car was gone.\n#Person1#: Drivers like that should be punished by the police.\n#Person2#: I agree. I won't forget this for a long time.\n#Person1#: I am sure you won't.\n#Person2#: Yes,from now on I won't cross the street reading my newspaper. I'll have to watch where I'm going, since there are dangerous drivers like that one on the road.",
    "#Person1#: Can you help me do an internet search? \n#Person2#: Sure. What do you want to find? \n#Person1#: I want to find information on World War Two. \n#Person2#: Well, can you be more specific? There are a lot of websites about that. \n#Person1#: Yes, I want to know about the Normandy Landing. \n#Person2#: Ok. Well, go to www. google. com, and type in Normandy Landing. \n#Person1#: Oh, wow! There are lot of sites. \n#Person2#: Here, try this one. It's a good site about Normandy Landing. \n#Person1#: Thanks. \n#Person2#: For ditailed information, however, you should read a history book. \n#Person1#: Thanks.

If you follow the direction, it's quite simple.\n#Person1#: I read it, but I couldn't understand it.

It's like a dream come true. I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize!\n#Person1#: You did a good job. I'm extremely proud of you.\n#Person2#: Thanks for the compliment.\n#Person1#: You certainly deserve it. Let's celebrate!",
    "#Person1#: Would you like to know about benefits and so forth?\n#Person2#: Please. Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something!\n#Person1#: With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits. For example, head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations. This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly.\n#Person2#: That is wonderful. We've been having serious problems in that area. Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment, nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money.\n#Person1#: Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that. If you are sure, we can go ahead now, Sir. How does 10 am tomorrow sound, to get all of the paperwork out of the way?",
    "#Person1#: Excuse me, Alice, I've never used this place before. Can you tell me how to use the machines?\n#Person2#: What do you mean? These are the washing machines. Those big things over there are the dryers.\n#Person1#: I see. Do the machines have soap in them?\n#Person2#: No, of course not. You have to put soap in. Did you bring your soap?\n#Person1#: No, I don't have soap.\n#Person2#: Well, you can buy some over there.\n#Person1#: Thanks. OK, I have my soap.\n#Person2#: My god, you really bought a lot. Why do you need so much?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I want my clothes to be clean.\n#Person2#: But you can't use so much. The machines won't be able to remove the soap completely. On the contrary, too many bubbles trapped dirt, allowing bacteria to build up.\n#Person1#: Oh, I guess I didn't know. I have never washed close before.\n#Person2#: What? Did you say you never wash clothes before?\n#Person1#: Yes, never.\n#Person2#: I can't believe it. How can that be?\n#Person1#: My mother always did it.\n#Person2#: Yes, my mother washed my clothes, too. But when I was 12, I started to wash clothes myself.\n#Person1#: I know about this fact. American children are more independent. But in my country, the mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school, so she does everything for the kids.\n#Person2#: Then how are you going to survive on the campus?\n#Person1#: I don't know. It's hard, but I have to learn.",

You should drink some tea and stay warm. Would you like me to make you some soup?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. I'm not hungry. I might just go to sleep actually.

See you next week!",
    "#Person1#: Do you think our headmaster is going to build a new lab building?\n#Person2#: I've no idea. He may have the plan. But he hasn't spoken to us teachers about it.\n#Person1#: Do you think it possible that it will happen?\n#Person2#: Of course. Right now, our old lab building can't satisfy the increasing need of teaching. It's too small and not in proper condition.\n#Person1#: Why don't we build a new one as soon as possible?\n#Person2#: There may be some problems with it.\n#Person1#: What's the problem then?\n#Person2#: As far as I know, money is. It's not likely to be solved soon, I guess.\n#Person1#: I believe our headmaster will ask the local government to help us build a new one.\n#Person2#: I think so. It's quite likely that the decision will be made before the end of this term.",
    "#Person1#: Well, Sir, we have asked all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant.\n#Person2#: I didn't know that, can I borrow a jacket and a tie now?\n#Person1#: I am sorry. You can't borrow a jacket or a tie from others.\n#Person2#: That I have to return to the hotel and fetch mine.\n#Person1#: Will you put off the time of the conference?\n#Person2#: Since you are the chairman we'd like to offer you the convenience. What time will you come back?\n#Person1#: I think I should be back at about 9:00 AM.\n#Person2#: We'll put it off to 9:30 AM. What about that?\n#Person1#: 9:30 AM will be fine with me.

But when I was twelve, I started to wash clothes myself.\n#Person1#: I know about this fact. American children are more independent. They do more for themselves. But I am from Taiwan. In Taiwan, children must study very hard. So the mother does everything for the kids. The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school. So I've never washed clothes before.

I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.\n#Person1#: That would be convenient. They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time. It's really annoying!\n#Person2#: Yeah you are right. This office is falling apart! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking lot was flooded.\n#Person1#: I know! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day!

    "#Person1#: So that concludes the introduction. Now let's move to the first part of my talk, which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan. So first, right off the bat, When looking at the marketing plan, tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with...\n#Person2#: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...\n#Person1#: That's correct. If you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. Now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. First, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year. Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts. If you look at the overhead, you'll see a graph... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005, the red line is the sales in 2006... As you can see, our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with, but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year. On the other hand, you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket.",

I have never tried that way.\n#Person1#: Well, it's very convenient and very popular now.\n#Person2#: So how to apply for a job on the Internet?\n#Person1#: Just get online and send your application through email to the employer.\n#Person2#: But how can I know which employer is hiring?\n#Person1#: You could place your job hunting information on the Job Wanted channel on a recruitment website.\n#Person2#: Will the employers see my information?\n#Person1#: Yes.

    "#Person1#: Is there anything wrong? \n#Person2#: I'm worried about my daughter. She can't decide about college. \n#Person1#: Don't worry. That's just a part of being a teenager. \n#Person2#: I don't mind that. But she disagrees with me about everything. \n#Person1#: You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself. You shouldn't affect her decision. \n#Person2#: But I just want to give her some tips. \n#Person1#: Oh, she can make her own decisions. ",
    "#Person1#: I don't know what I'm going to do! It's going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job! \n#Person2#: Don't worry. I don't think you're going to lose your job over one mistake. \n#Person1#: It was a rather big mistake. When you work as an investment adviser, one small mistake can cost the company millions. \n#Person2#: But it wasn't just you who was involved, right? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do. \n#Person1#: That's true, but my supervisor is very dishonest. There's no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth. I'm sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault, and there's nothing I can do about that. My boss won't believe me if I tell him the truth. \n#Person2#: Let's think realistically about what might happen. How much money do you have in your savings? \n#Person1#: I have enough to live off of for about 3 months. But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living! I'd rather invest my money somehow. \n#Person2#: Well, you can't have everything. Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job. When is your contract up on your apartment? \n#Person1#: Next month. So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year. \n#Person2#: Well, that's good. If you lose your job, you can just move in with me until you find another job. That will save you plenty of money. \n#Person1#: That's very generous of you. I guess that would work. \n#Person2#: If you lose your job, you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy. If you live frugally, you'll save plenty of money. \n#Person1#: I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy. Maybe losing my job would be a good thing! ",

    "#Person1#: Do you drink much?\n#Person2#: Depending on what you consider a lot.\n#Person1#: How frequently do you drink?\n#Person2#: Couple times a week. How about you?\n#Person1#: Only when I go out. I'm not a big drinker.\n#Person2#: How much can you drink?\n#Person1#: I usually only have 2 beers.\n#Person2#: You're a light weight.\n#Person1#: How much can you drink?\n#Person2#: I'm usually drinking all night long. At least 10 drinks.\n#Person1#: Don't you spend a lot of money then?\n#Person2#: No. We usually go to places that have specials. Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5. 00 pitchers on Mondays. So for ten, fifteen bucks, I can get a lot of drinks.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: If you don't like beer, have you tried mixed drinks? Some of them are pretty good.\n#Person1#: I like beer, it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3.\n#Person2#: You just have to build up a tolerance. I used to be like that. But your body gets used to it.\n#Person1#: It'll take awhile, but I'm working on it.\n#Person2#: Hey let's go out tomorrow night. The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers.\n#Person1#: Alright.",

    "#Person1#:  So is there any other area I should look at as well?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd recommend West Derby. That will be closer to your office.\n#Person1#:  That sounds good.\n#Person2#:  Yes, and if you have children, it also has very good schools.\n#Person1#:  That's not my concern. I live on my own so I'm only looking for a cheap single room, something like a flat.\n#Person2#:  Umm, that may be a problem here in this area then, because there are mostly larger houses here. You'd probably be able to share one with other people who want to rent though.\n#Person1#:  No, I'm only interested in flats at the moment.\n#Person2#:  We actually have another office in South Derby, and the guy who works there is a really good friend of mine. His name is John Godfrey.\n#Person1#:  Could you tell me his telephone number?\n#Person2#:  It's 074263951.\n#Person1#:  Great. Is there a good time to call him?

Why would someone want to do that?\n#Person1#: You sit in front of the TV watching baseball for 3 hours every Saturday. And many people would find that boring, too.\n#Person2#: OK, relax. Let's see what else.\n#Person1#: Photography. That looks interesting. It started last week, but I don't think that would be a problem.\n#Person2#: But look at the price. $280 is too much for me. I wonder why it's so expensive. I don't think I can afford it. But, hey, at least it's $40 cheaper than the Italian wine course. Look at that. $400 web design for beginners. It's pretty cheap. What do you think?\n#Person1#: I don't want to see a computer in the evening too.\n#Person2#: Hey, look. How about Indian cooking? Starts this week. A little bit expensive.\n#Person1#: $190. You know how much I love Indian food. I'll call him tomorrow to see if there are still spaces available.\n#Person2#: I'll call them right away.\n#Person1#: There won't be anyone there now.

    "#Person1#: Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get started using these machines?\n#Person2#: Of course. Are you a new member here?\n#Person1#: Yes.\n#Person2#: Welcome. My name is Johnson.\n#Person1#: Nice to meet you.\n#Person2#: Do you have any experience using weights?\n#Person1#: No, I don't. So I need some help.\n#Person2#: Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch. You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines.\n#Person1#: Yes, I know that. Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room. So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines.\n#Person2#: Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you.\n#Person1#: What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one.\n#Person2#: No. Not that. I mean a training card. The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine. Here, let me show you.\n#Person1#: I'm ready.\n#Person2#: Now, you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed. So, when you go through the series of twelve machines, you enter in the number of repetitions you do. And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine.\n#Person1#: I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress.\n#Person2#: Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine. Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them. And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you.\n#Person1#: Alright. Great.\n#Person2#: So you write your name and member number at the top of the card. And then, after you exercise each time, you file the card here.\n#Person1#: Great. Why don't we start on the machines?\n#Person2#: Are you alright? Can you do more?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted.\n#Person2#: That's okay. Don't worry. It's important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning.\n#Person1#: What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines.\n#Person2#: We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really. The most important thing is to know your limits. So if you feel burned out now, it is good to stop. Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right?\n#Person1#: Yes. I suppose it's best to stop.",

Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world?\n#Person2#: I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action, but I doubt it'll happen before it's too late.  \n#Person1#: We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere. There's lots of clean, modern technology, but companies in developed countries say it's expensive. Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environmental protection.\n#Person2#: Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term, rather than the long term. It's the same with the destruction of the rainforests. Countries and companies just want the wood. They're not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests. We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life.  \n#Person1#: In other parts of the world, especially in Africa, there is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow enough food.  \n#Person2#: It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains. Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people.  \n#Person1#: Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment.  \n#Person2#: I think I'd like to do that. I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies.

He also was famous for never giving up on his goals.\n#Person1#: That's right. He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected.\n#Person2#: And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights.\n#Person1#: He had great vision, didn't he?\n#Person2#: And humility.

I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. It was too much for me.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry to hear that. This room is at the end of the corridor.

I don't think you're going to lose your job over one mistake. \n#Person1#: It was a rather big mistake. When you work as an investment adviser, one small mistake can cost the company millions. \n#Person2#: But it wasn't just you who was involved, right? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do. \n#Person1#: That's true, but my supervisor is very dishonest. There's no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth.

Instead of hiring temporary stuff, the company advertises posts on its website that retired employees like myself can access.\n#Person1#: What sort of works advertised?\n#Person2#: Well, all sorts of things, really. Administrative work and more specialized work, the sort of thing I can do. Some of the projects can last five or six months, and others can just be a couple of days. I can decide more or less when to work. So I can manage my own time.\n#Person1#: I can see it's good for you. What is your company get out of this?\n#Person2#: Well, I still have all my old contacts at work, so I know who to contact to get something done. The company gets flexibility, too.

It's a small village that has recently made remarkable economic progress. It used to be very backward, but now the place has completely changed. Could you let me know which you'd prefer sometime this morning so that we can make the necessary arrangements?\n#Person2#: Well, I think I'd rather visit the village in the mountains.\n#Person1#: All right.

If you live frugally, you'll save plenty of money. \n#Person1#: I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy. Maybe losing my job would be a good thing! ",

Have you lost your passport?\n#Person1#: I think so. I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store.\n#Person2#: Where exactly did you use your passport in the store?\n#Person1#: In the shoe department. I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques.\n#Person2#: Well, let me call the shoe department to see if they'Ve found a passport. Sorry, your passport hasn't turned up there either.\n#Person1#: Then what shall I do?\n#Person2#: You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it. These kinds of things usually turn up eventually, but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation, so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up.\n#Person1#: You are right. Do you have a pen?\n#Person2#: Here you are.\n#Person1#: Oh, I seem to lose something every time I travel.",
    "#Person1#: Maggie, can I borrow your notes for history? I'll return them tomorrow.\n#Person2#: Sorry, but I usually go to the cafeteria and review them. Why not copy them in the library?\n#Person1#: OK.\n#Person2#: Here you are.\n#Person1#: You are a great help, Maggie.\n#Person2#: I don't quite understand a why you need my notes, Mark? You haven't missed any classes.\n#Person1#: To be honest, I work in supermarket from 7 to 10 o'clock every evening.\n#Person2#: I see. So you're pretty tired when you come to class.\n#Person1#: That's exactly why I want to borrow your notes. My notes aren't very good.\n#Person2#: So what do you usually do in class?\n#Person1#: I'm always awake at the beginning, but thirty minutes after class begins I feel sleepy and have trouble keeping my eyes open.\n#Person2#: Well, I need someone to study with and you need someone to keep you awake. Can we be study partners?\n#Person1#: Oh sure. That's a good idea. So give me a push when you see me sleeping in class.\n#Person2#: OK. Let's start today in the library. We are going there anyway and I don't have to go to the cafeteria.\n#Person1#: Sounds good.",
    "#Person1#: Does your country export a lot of natural resources?\n#Person2#: We export some coal to European countries, but our biggest exports is copper, which we export to Europe, north America, and China.\n#Person1#: Which resources do you have to import?\n#Person2#: We import a little oil from Venezuela, but we are fairly self-sufficient. We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries.\n#Person1#: I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. So far, only small deposits have been found. Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil. The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country.\n#Person1#: If your government invests in your country's infrastructure, it will be money well spent.\n#Person2#: Yes. We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones.",

Are you short of cash?\n#Person2#: No, I'm Okay.\n#Person1#: You'd better hurry up if you want a dorm room next September. There aren't enough rooms for every one, and first year students have priority.\n#Person2#: Well, I've been thinking about living off campus.\n#Person1#: Have you any idea of how much that would cost? There is the rent, utilities, and you'd probably need a car.\n#Person2#: I know it would be more expensive. I think I can handle it though. The dorm is just so noisy that I can't get anything done. Maybe my grades would be better if I had some peace and quiet in a place of my own.\n#Person1#: You should study in the library the way I do. Think of the money you'd save.\n#Person2#: I've got to think it over some more. There's still two weeks left in April.",
    "#Person1#: Excuse me. I get confused that the two phones on the booth are different, can you tell me how to use them?\n#Person2#: Let me have a look. Oh, yes. This one is the IC phone and the other is the coin phone. If you have an IC card, you can insert it into this slot, wait for the dialing signal appearing on the small screen, and then dial the number of the person you are going to call.\n#Person1#: Well, I see. How to use the other one?\n#Person2#: First, you pick up the receiver, wait for the dialing signal, dial the number, and then put the coin into the slot, press the'speak'button.

Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on?\n#Person1#: no, we decided to stay in our apartment. With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt, many people had no choice but to walk home. It was utter chaos.\n#Person2#: did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center?\n#Person1#: yes, my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers.\n#Person2#: did he survive?\n#Person1#: unfortunately, he wasn't able to evacuate in time. He ended up dying in the tower.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family.\n#Person1#: it was.

    "#Person1#: How did you get interested in country music?\n#Person2#: Well, when my wife and I first caught our record player. We started to buy all kinds of records, soon, I found that I was buying more country music records than any other kind.\n#Person1#: How did you start working for the radio station?\n#Person2#: I thought there should be a radio program of country songs, so I went to CBC, and suggested it. That was how we started the program called Golden Country Time.\n#Person1#: Then you were asked to write articles to explain the background of those songs.\n#Person2#: Yes, but soon I got tired of running to the library to find information.

I have decided to create my own company! I am going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself!\n#Person2#: Have you ever written up a business plan before?\n#Person1#: Well, no, it can't be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that's it, right?\n#Person2#: You couldn't be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.\n#Person1#: Well, that seems easy enough.\n#Person2#: Wait, there is more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.\n#Person1#: Geez. Is that all?\n#Person2#: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!\n#Person1#: Umm.

I see.",

By the last day, they didn't want to go home because they were having such a great time.\n#Person1#: What sort of things did you do with them?\n#Person2#: Well, there were some trips, including a visit to the Holyrood, the Castle. That was what we did on the first day. I think they were expecting it to be rather boring, especially when they heard they were having a guided tour. But they were wrong. The guide was very interesting. He told them some interesting stories of Edinburgh and really made the history of the Edinburgh castle come alive.\n#Person1#: I can imagine. What sort of sports activities did they do?\n#Person2#: Ceiling, climbing, horse-riding and the like. And on the last day, we had a barbeque, which was their favorite. The kids enjoyed it very much. They all promised to come and get together again next year.",

I want to wear it to the country because I want to take pictures there.\n#Person1#: Then have you packed your camera in your bag?\n#Person2#: No, few young people use cameras to take pictures now.

I want to travel light.\n#Person1#: I made them especially for your grandparents. They love my cookies very much. I'm sure they'll be disappointed if you don't take them with you. I've told them you take the cookies to them.\n#Person2#: All right, I'll take them.\n#Person1#: Good. So when will David get here?\n#Person2#: He left home about 20 minutes ago. It takes him just 30 minutes to get here on foot. I guess, he'll be here in just about 10 minutes.",

What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good?\n#Person2#: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration.\n#Person1#: I see.\n#Person2#: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise?\n#Person1#: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time. But I never go to the gym like you do.\n#Person2#: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports?\n#Person1#: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now.

I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company. . . They're supposed to be bitter enemies, the strictest of competitors. It must be a rumor. It can't be true.\n#Person1#: I read it myself on the financial page. They're really going to join together. U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's, they will take over the company as of next month.\n#Person2#: The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes. Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy?\n#Person1#: I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition. If you can't beat'em, join'em.",

How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?\n#Person2#: You're so picky sometimes.\n#Person1#: Here you go, honey, fried eggs.\n#Person2#: I said sunny side up! How many times do I have to tell you.",
    "#Person1#: Hi, Ann, welcome back. How's your trip to the states?\n#Person2#: Very busy. I had a lot of meetings. So, of course, I didn't have much time to see New York.\n#Person1#: What a pity. Actually I have a trip there myself next week.\n#Person2#: Do you? Then take my advice. Do the well-being in the air program. It really works.\n#Person1#: Oh, I read about that in a magazine. You say it works?\n#Person2#: Yes. I did the program on the flight to the States. And when I arrived in New York, I didn't have any problem. No jet leg at all. On the way back I didn't do it, and I felt terrible.\n#Person1#: You are joking.\n#Person2#: Not at all. It really made a lot of difference.\n#Person1#: Hmm...So, what did you do?\n#Person2#: Well, I didn't drink any alcohol or coffee and I didn't eat any meat or rich food. I drink a lot of water and fruit juice and I eat the meals on the well-being menu. They are lighter. They have fish, vegetables and noodles, for example. And I did some of the exercises in the program.\n#Person1#: Exercises? On a plane?\n#Person2#: Yes. I didn't do many, of course. There isn't much space on the plane.\n#Person1#: How many passengers did the exercises?\n#Person2#: Not many.\n#Person1#: And how much champagne did they drink?\n#Person2#: A lot. It was more popular than mineral water.\n#Person1#: So, basically it's a choice. Mineral water and exercises or champagne and jet lag.\n#Person2#: That's right. It's a difficult choice.",
    "#Person1#: Tina, how long have you been learning the piano?\n#Person2#: For 8 years. I began to play when I was 7.

I almost got fainted.\n#Person1#: I could not and can't make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick. He plays the field with many girls.\n#Person2#: But Sarah says she does not care, so long as he loves her.",

What's up with you?\n#Person1#: Believe it or not, the company I worked for closed down, so I'm out of a job.\n#Person2#: The same with me. Have you given much thought to what you want to do next?\n#Person1#: I am not being all that particular right now because I just need to keep a roof over my head.\n#Person2#: How about interviews? Have you been on any of those yet?\n#Person1#: I wish that I could get the opportunity to be interviewed.\n#Person2#: How about the electrician program that they have listed over there?\n#Person1#: I read about that, and the position sounded great!\n#Person2#: Let's go see how we can apply for those positions.",

Could I try it on? \n#Person1#: Sure. \n#Person2#: It's cute. The color suits my complexion. How much does it cost?\n#Person1#: 400 dollars.\n#Person2#: What? That's ridiculous!",
    "#Person1#: Tom, how do you think of second-hand goods?\n#Person2#: Why did you ask that? Do you want to buy the used goods?\n#Person1#: I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now.\n#Person2#: You know the car I'm driving, which is still in good condition though it is second-hand. And it only cost me 300 dollars. It was so cheap.\n#Person1#: But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones?\n#Person2#: It depends. So you must be careful buying second-hand goods.",
    "#Person1#: OK, that's a cut! Let's start from the beginning, everyone.\n#Person2#: What was the problem that time?\n#Person1#: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you any more, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\n#Person2#: But Jason and Laura have been together for three years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\n#Person1#: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would, and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\n#Person2#: I'm not so sure about that.\n#Person1#: Let's try it my way, and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right, we can try something else.",

Is he back yet?\n#Person2#: No, he won't come back for several more weeks.\n#Person1#: Wow! He must have a lot to do there.\n#Person2#: Yes, he does.\n#Person1#: I want to be sure of the time because I'm going to meet a friend at five o'clock sharp.\n#Person2#: Well, my watch says 4:30, and that time should be right. I set it with the radio yesterday.\n#Person1#: Good.",

We started to buy all kinds of records, soon, I found that I was buying more country music records than any other kind.\n#Person1#: How did you start working for the radio station?\n#Person2#: I thought there should be a radio program of country songs, so I went to CBC, and suggested it. That was how we started the program called Golden Country Time.\n#Person1#: Then you were asked to write articles to explain the background of those songs.\n#Person2#: Yes, but soon I got tired of running to the library to find information. So I started buying country song books and building my own library.",

With the extension of railways and highways, and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes, ships and boats have been giving place to trains, planes and automobiles.\n#Person1#: I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 %.\n#Person2#: The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster, so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow.

He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked.\n#Person1#: no, it's not going to be George. I don't think it's Andy either. He is involved with the boss's sister in-law. And you know how whipped our boss is.\n#Person2#: that's true. What about Lisa? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her.\n#Person1#: Lisa? No way.

It's like she's decided to make herself at home in her office. I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to her about it.\n#Person2#: She was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast.

When did you know you wanted to have your own company?\n#Person2#: My family left Budapest in 1986 and settled in Canada where a lot of my friends' parents were highly successful businessmen. It seems so cool, so in high school, I started a web-designed company and learned a lot from that experience.\n#Person1#: How did you find the money for your present company then?\n#Person2#: We've raised 18 million dollars from about 50 people. We're finally making money. I own 6% of the company and all employees get their shares.\n#Person1#: By the way, what aspects of your life are green?\n#Person2#: I'm only mildly green. I do simple things and I'm a huge biker. I biked cross Canada.\n#Person1#: Do you think you have ever done anything wasteful?\n#Person2#: We're always doing something wrong, but then, that will allow us to learn and grow. When I first started out, we made all the products ourselves, but that was a mistake. Now we work with other companies. We provide the materials, the product development and the design. They make the products then.",

It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal.\n#Person1#: So what do you think of the American fast food culture?\n#Person2#: I think America really deserves the name of fast food nation - as people can find McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States.\n#Person1#: And everyone knows that Americans'favorite food is the hamburger, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Sure.

    "#Person1#: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.\n#Person2#: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\n#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?\n#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\n#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\n#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.\n#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\n#Person2#: Fifty meters.\n#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\n#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n#Person2#: No, not at this stage.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.",

Which one do you want? \n#Person2#: Well, the desk by the window is nicer, of course. Don't you think? \n#Person1#: Yes, I agree. \n#Person2#: So since I got the bottom bunk, why don't you get the desk by the window? That would be more fair. \n#Person1#: Alright. \n#Person2#: I mean, we could flip a coin for it, but I would probably win again. I'm incredibly lucky you know. Especially with girls. \n#Person1#: Is that right? \n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. \n#Person1#: Well, I hope you let me hang out with you then. Maybe I can learn from you. \n#Person2#: Oh, certainly.

You've put on, like, a ton of weight since I saw you at Christmas time. What on earth happened to you?\n#Person2#: Why are you always so blunt?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm your big sister. I'm ... what am I? Three years older than you, and I can be blunt if I want. Besides, you used to say stuff like that to me all of the time.

It's great, but you also need to learn how to eat right. For example, you need to eat smaller portions. And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties.\n#Person2#: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate!\n#Person1#: Andrew! That won't help. Next \n#Person2#: Oh, next? \n#Person1#: . Oh yeah. So, first of all, smaller portions \n#Person2#: Okay.\n#Person1#: Then, you need to make sure you eat a good, well-balanced breakfast first thing in the morning \n#Person2#: I do that. \n#Person1#: And then you follow that up with smaller meals throughout the day, cause, you know what? If you skip breakfast, then throughout the day, you feel like you need to make up it by overeating at lunch and dinner and lots of snacks.\n#Person2#: Uh ... \n#Person1#: Anyway, um, oh yeah. Don't eat late at night.\n#Person2#:  What? Like what?\n#Person1#:  Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat.

All you eat is ice cream? Oh, oh, oh. Look in your trash. You go to McDonalds every day. Every day you're eating at fast food? \n#Person2#: Well ...\n#Person1#: Okay, you got to cut out the fast food.

It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. \n#Person2#:  Oh, well. \n#Person1#: cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day.\n#Person2#: I don't drink five gallons.\n#Person1#: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups!

Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says?\n#Person1#: You know she probably feels just as bad.\n#Person2#: Well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often.\n#Person1#: Well, in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I'll call later to patch things up.",

Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal?\n#Person2#: ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China. You know, in the past, people could not afford to eat out like they can today.\n#Person1#: I guess that makes sense. I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home.\n#Person2#: well, if you want, you can take the leftovers home.\n#Person1#: no, that's OK. You know what they say when in Rome. . .\n#Person2#: I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet.

I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company. . . They're supposed to be bitter enemies, the strictest of competitors. It must be a rumor. It can't be true.\n#Person1#: I read it myself on the financial page. They're really going to join together. U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's, they will take over the company as of next month.\n#Person2#: The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes. Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy?\n#Person1#: I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.

That took almost two weeks.\n#Person1#: What kind of documents did you need to present?\n#Person2#: I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education, because I want a student visa.\n#Person1#: Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected?\n#Person2#: I think that they don't complete the forms correctly or they don't include all the required documents. The embassy is very strict about it. You have to be quite careful.\n#Person1#: Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities?\n#Person2#: That's simple. Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions.",
    "#Person1#: Excuse me, Alice, I've never used this place before. Can you tell me how to use the machines?\n#Person2#: What do you mean? These are the washing machines. Those big things over there are the dryers.\n#Person1#: I see. Do the machines have soap in them?\n#Person2#: No, of course not. You have to put soap in. Did you bring your soap?\n#Person1#: No, I don't have soap.\n#Person2#: Well, you can buy some over there.\n#Person1#: Thanks. OK, I have my soap.\n#Person2#: My god, you really bought a lot. Why do you need so much?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I want my clothes to be clean.\n#Person2#: But you can't use so much. The machines won't be able to remove the soap completely. On the contrary, too many bubbles trapped dirt, allowing bacteria to build up.\n#Person1#: Oh, I guess I didn't know. I have never washed close before.\n#Person2#: What? Did you say you never wash clothes before?\n#Person1#: Yes, never.\n#Person2#: I can't believe it. How can that be?\n#Person1#: My mother always did it.\n#Person2#: Yes, my mother washed my clothes, too. But when I was 12, I started to wash clothes myself.\n#Person1#: I know about this fact. American children are more independent. But in my country, the mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school, so she does everything for the kids.\n#Person2#: Then how are you going to survive on the campus?\n#Person1#: I don't know.

What's the game that you got?\n#Person1#: It's a game where you create your own character. You can choose how you look and dress and act.\n#Person2#: Interesting. I've never played something like that. It sounds really different.\n#Person1#: It is. Please be sure to come over. I can't wait to show you.",
    "#Person1#: Is your city a historical place? \n#Person2#: Not rally. 200 years ago, it was just a small insignificant village. \n#Person1#: How did it grow into such a large place? \n#Person2#: Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here. The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre. \n#Person1#: As the city grew, it must have absorbed many village nearby. \n#Person2#: Yes, it did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city. \n#Person1#: I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city? \n#Person2#: Oh, yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive. Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs. There was a castle near one village, so our city has a castle too. \n#Person1#: Really? So your city does have some old history after all. ",

Where were you?\n#Person1#: I was at home with my parents in New York City.\n#Person2#: really? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers?\n#Person1#: I didn't see the crash itself, but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents' apartment building.\n#Person2#: that must have been horrible. Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on?\n#Person1#: no, we decided to stay in our apartment. With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt, many people had no choice but to walk home.

That's just a part of being a teenager. \n#Person2#: I don't mind that. But she disagrees with me about everything. \n#Person1#: You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself.

What is your budget for the dinner?\n#Person1#: She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her.\n#Person2#: Well, what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant? It is very upscale, with a three-star rating.\n#Person1#: I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight. How about another restaurant?\n#Person2#: The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated. It has great food and live jazz, but it's not cheap.\n#Person1#: Yes, that sounds like a winner. Would you please call them to reserve a table?\n#Person2#: I'm already dialing, sir.",
    "#Person1#: Hi, Laura. Where are you heading with that big bag?\n#Person2#: I'm off to the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know.\n#Person1#: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good?\n#Person2#: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration.\n#Person1#: I see.\n#Person2#: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise?\n#Person1#: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time. But I never go to the gym like you do.\n#Person2#: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports?\n#Person1#: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV\n#Person2#: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself.\n#Person1#: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming.\n#Person2#: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime?\n#Person1#: Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that.",

Can you tell me?\n#Person1#: He says kick mommy, beat mommy, don't want mommy very quickly if I do something that he doesn't like. You know, if I wash his face or change his clothes, things like that.\n#Person2#: Honey, I don't know what to tell you. Of course Tony is a young child. But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason.\n#Person1#: Yes, but sometimes he is just not reasonable.\n#Person2#: I suggest you treat him with patience, affection, and respect. If he needs to do something, like go to bed, or be washed, etc. , please guide or help him to get it done, but lead him with gentleness.\n#Person1#: It's easy to say, but I will try.\n#Person2#: Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior. Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods, etc. Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire.\n#Person1#: I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him. But this doesn't work, instead he picks up another bad habit.",

How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, it won't cost you much. It's only around $ 59. 95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America.\n#Person2#: Hey, How did you know I came from America?\n#Person1#: Just a hunch, sir.\n#Person2#: How much again?\n#Person1#: $ 59. 95.\n#Person2#: That's really cheap for shoes like those. OK, I'll take 5 pairs.\n#Person1#: Sorry, sir.\n#Person2#: Why not?\n#Person1#: Because in this duty-free shop, your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife.\n#Person2#: Oh, my God.

    "#Person1#: What are the main differences between this country and your country?\n#Person2#: Well, in Russia, everything happens very fast. People talk quickly, they drive their cars too fast, the good deals go by really quickly...but here in Canada, it seems like people are a little more relaxed.\n#Person1#: Is that true for everything?\n#Person2#: No, of course not. In Russia, going to the bank can take hours. The same is true for the post office and the supermarket. In Canada, however, these places are pretty easy to get through quickly.\n#Person1#: So, what is it that makes some things go either faster or slower compared to us here in Canada? I was born and raised here, so I guess I don't notice these things. I've also never been outside the country before.\n#Person2#: I think the people in Russia are fast movers by nature, at least in the big cities. Public places are still very slow because they haven't tried to do business any differently than they used to.\n#Person1#: But in Canada, it's the opposite?\n#Person2#: Right. The government here does a great job of solving problems and using new technology to make businesses work better. But I think Canadians are just more calm in general than Russians are... and they're definitely more relaxed than Americans!\n#Person1#: Well, I agree with you about that last part!",

Hmm, by the way, what do you do about tipping in China? \n#Person1#: We don't . \n#Person2#: No tipping? Now that's what I call a civilized system. \n#Person1#: At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill, but other than that , tipping isn't customary. \n#Person2#: What about cab drivers and porters? \n#Person1#: In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter. I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag, but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities. \n#Person2#: You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here.

I have never tried that way.\n#Person1#: Well, it's very convenient and very popular now.\n#Person2#: So how to apply for a job on the Internet?\n#Person1#: Just get online and send your application through email to the employer.\n#Person2#: But how can I know which employer is hiring?\n#Person1#: You could place your job hunting information on the Job Wanted channel on a recruitment website.\n#Person2#: Will the employers see my information?\n#Person1#: Yes.

How about give me a ring, then?\n#Person2#: No. I'd better not.\n#Person1#: Why not?\n#Person2#: Because I don't think my husband would like it. Thank you for inviting me anyway.",
    "#Person1#: You look pale, Stephanie. What's wrong?\n#Person2#: I don't feel good. I have a bad headache. In fact, I haven't got much sleep this past week and I feel really tired.\n#Person1#: Why don't you go to see a doctor?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I think I should but I have a report due tomorrow. Miss Jenkins needs it for the board meeting next Monday.\n#Person1#: Well, it's Wednesday today. Why don't you talk to Miss Jenkins and ask if you can hand it in on Friday morning?\n#Person2#: Maybe I should try. I guess I just need a good sleep.

How much do you charge for it?\n#Person1#: Thirty for each adult, twenty each kid.\n#Person2#: I see. Where can I get the food?\n#Person1#: Please go to the tables over there for cold dishes and vegetables.

    "#Person1#: Yes. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. You see, I've bought this personal stereo at your shop 3 days ago. And I'm afraid it hasn't really matched up to what I was told about.\n#Person1#: I see, what exactly is the matter?\n#Person2#: Well, first of all, there is this large scratch across the front of it.\n#Person1#: But you should have noticed that when you bought it.\n#Person2#: But it was in the box and all sealed up.\n#Person1#: Well. I'm sorry, but it really is your responsibility to check the goods when you buy them. How are we to know that it wasn't you who made the scratch?\n#Person2#: But that's ridiculous. But anyway, it's not the most important thing. I really am not happy about this other thing.\n#Person1#: And what is that?\n#Person2#: Look. It says here that the noise from it should be undetectable by other people.\n#Person1#: Yes, that's right.\n#Person2#: But people can hear it, and it's really embarrassing on the bus and underground.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm sorry, but it must be the way you are wearing the headphones.\n#Person2#: Look. I know how to put earphones in my ears. Thank you very much. But what I want to know is, what you are going to do about it at all?\n#Person1#: Well, I suppose we could exchange it for another model, if you really aren't happy with it.\n#Person2#: No, I certainly am not.\n#Person1#: Well, if I could just have the receipt.\n#Person2#: Oh yes. Well, there is a slight problem about the receipt.",
    "#Person1#: Thank you. Steven. That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad. You'll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing. \n#Person2#: Don't worry about it, Lin. That's no big deal. You know, Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture. Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter. Hmm, by the way, what do you do about tipping in China? \n#Person1#: We don't . \n#Person2#: No tipping? Now that's what I call a civilized system. \n#Person1#: At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill, but other than that , tipping isn't customary. \n#Person2#: What about cab drivers and porters? \n#Person1#: In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter. I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag, but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities. \n#Person2#: You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here.

What did you have in mind? \n#Person1#: I haven't deceided yet, but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must. \n#Person2#: I agree. They're very lovely, especially 'Huan Huan'. \n#Person1#: is that the red one? That is my favorite, too. Do you know how much they are? \n#Person2#: the five dolls are sold together as a set, and they're priced according to the size. The bigger they are the more expensive. \n#Person1#: oh, I see. If I buy more than a set, can I get any discount? \n#Person2#: I don't think so. All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now. \n#Person1#: any other ideas? \n#Person2#: there are lots of things, such as postcards, key chains, posters and various arts and crafts. \n#Person1#: it all sounds great.

The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation.\n#Person2#: It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody!\n#Person1#: You are quite right.",

About two weeks?\n#Person1#: Well, we were going to but now one or two of the other students say they don't have enough money, so it'll just be a week.

Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store?\n#Person2#: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them.

She's just new in town. You have a thing for blonds, eh?\n#Person2#: yeah! She could do anything she wants to me!\n#Person1#: I bet. Why not go over and talk to her? She's really nice.\n#Person2#: I don't think so. I get so nervous talking to girls. I always put my foot in my mouth, scare her off, and end up looking like a real fool. Besides, she is way out of my league.\n#Person1#: come on! Man up! You'll never know until you try.\n#Person2#: okay okay, just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game.\n#Person1#: all right.

It seems everyone in town is so friendly.\n#Person2#: This is a small town, and we like to be neighborly. We know everyone who lives around here.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm from Chicago. There are few people take the time to get to know their neighbors.\n#Person2#: So, tell me, Karl, why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live?\n#Person1#: We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space. Another reason is, we can afford to buy a home here, but we can't in Chicago!",
    "#Person1#: Well, you must be happy, Nathan you're almost ready to go to Chicago for your practice. We're sure going to miss you around here.\n#Person2#: I'll miss you too, mom. But yeah, I'm excited about my summer. And don't be too sad. I'll be back in a few months, in time for the first day of school. By winter break, you'll hardly remember I was even gone.\n#Person1#: So how do you think you'll do in the big city? Are you worried about working for a big newspaper like the Chicago Tribune?\n#Person2#: Not really. I'm not afraid of hard work and I know how to organize my day. I think I'll do a good job.\n#Person1#: But doing for practice isn't just for the company to profit, is it? It's also for you to get experience. Do you even know what you'll be doing?\n#Person2#: I'm not worried about that. I've got a lot of natural curiosity. And I'm very social, I'm sure I'll learn from all the other people there.\n#Person1#: What if they stick you in some backroom by yourself just copying papers or taking out the trash?\n#Person2#: I don't think that will happen. They asked for someone who was good at editing, organizing computer files and keeping track of deadlines. And I already know who I'll be working with, one of their regular writers.\n#Person1#: That's good, so you will probably get some on the job training. This is such a great opportunity for you.",

I'm absolutely flat broke, and I owe my landlady $ 200. she's given me until Friday to give it to her, but I don't get paid until next Monday. Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid?\n#Person2#: I'd love to help you out, but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well. I had to get a new engine put into my car, and that ate up my savings.\n#Person1#: If you can't give me the full amount, a fraction of it would still help. I'll pay you back on Monday. I promise.\n#Person2#: Let's see, I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend. I can only spare about $ 20. I would give you more if I had it, I just don't have much money to my name right now.\n#Person1#: Thanks a lot Ayden. Every little bit will help. Tell you what, if you aren't doing anything tonight, why don't you come over and have dinner at my place.\n#Person2#: That'd be great. Thanks!

    "#Person1#: I enjoy going through secondhand bookstores, don't you? It's interesting to see what people used to enjoy reading. Did you see this old book of children's stories?\n#Person2#: Some of these books aren't so old, though. See? This novel was published only six years ago. It costs seventy-five cents.\n#Person1#: Hey! Look at this!\n#Person2#: What? Are you getting interested in nineteenth-century plays all of a sudden?\n#Person1#: Well, look at the words. Someone gave this book as a present, and wrote a note on the inside of the front cover. It's dated 1893. Maybe it's worth something.\n#Person2#: Everything on that shelf is worth fifty cents.\n#Person1#: But if this is the signature of someone who is well-known, it might bring a lot more. I hear William Shakespeare's signature is worth about a million dollars.\n#Person2#: Oh? I can hardly read what that one says. Who wrote it?\n#Person1#: The name looks like 'Harold Dickson'. Wasn't he a politician or something? I'm going to buy this book and see if I can find a name looks like that in the library.\n#Person2#: Good luck.

Are you sure?\n#Person1#: I wouldn't mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy.\n#Person2#: Running a farm would be totally different to you current job.\n#Person1#: That's one reason I'd like to try it. I'd really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office.\n#Person2#: You'd need a lot of training before becoming a farmer. It's not something you can just walk into.\n#Person1#: My uncle owns a farm and I'Ve spent some time working with him.

Mr. Johnson has been working at our Beijing office for over a year now. I think you two are from the same city. \n#Person2#: Hey there, Henry. Call me Pete. A New Yorker, eh? \n#Person3#: Born and raised in Brooklyn. Good to meet you, Pete. \n#Person2#: Brooklyn. . . that's a great neighborhood. I'm originally from Queens but moved down to Manhattan a while back. So. . . you're an expat in China. . . how's life over here working out for you? \n#Person3#: You know - I really love it. There are frustrations of course, such as traffic, pollution and the language barrier, but all in all, I give China a big thumbs up. \n#Person1#: Before you two get carried away in conversation, let's finalize our plans for the evening. I was thinking of dining at a well-known dumpling restaurant and then hitting a Karaoke bar for some fun! \n#Person2#: Everything sounded good until I heard the word 'Karaoke'. If there's one thing you don't want to hear, it's me singing. \n#Person3#: I sound like a frog that's suffering from a bad cold! But Karaoke is so popular in Asia that I've been dragged to at least two dozen of them so far. I've even learned a Chinese song or two. \n#Person1#: Hey. . . no Karaoke. . . no problem! We're here to have fun and if singing isn't fun. . . then forget it! I assume you like beer. \n#Person2#: Beer is quite possibly my very favorite liquid. \n#Person3#: Chinese beer is actually pretty good. I've sampled all of them so I should know! \n#Person1#: Great!

She looks like the intellectual type.\n#Person1#: Oh come on man! What kind of woman do you like?\n#Person2#: I want a woman who's affectionate and fulfills my every need, and that woman over there is just not the right type.\n#Person1#: Hey. Where have you been? Times are changing, and you're never going to find a woman who will shine your shoes and pick up after you all the time. Wake up.\n#Person2#: Oh really? I meet a lot of women like that, but not at this party. [Oh.] I also prefer a woman who'll stay home, cook, clean, and watch the kids.\n#Person1#: Okay, but what are your household responsibilities once you get home from work?\n#Person2#: Hmm. Eat, watch TV, and throw out the garbage.\n#Person1#: Wait, wait, wait. I can't believe I'm hearing this. In fact, you're never going to get married. I recently read a news report that said 40 percent of women don't think their husbands do their share around the house, and you seem to be that type.\n#Person2#: Well, that's the way I am, but what's YOUR idea of the perfect woman?\n#Person1#: Well, I like a woman who's outgoing, caring, and non-judgmental about people's differences, and it bothers me when people think their the center of the universe ... like someone I know.\n#Person2#: Well, that's nice for you, but that doesn't change my point of view. I guess I'll have to go home to a TV dinner and my dog, Rusty.\n#Person1#: Hey, and if I stick with you, this is going to be a long, lonely night. Say hello to Rusty for me.",

    "#Person1#: Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast?\n#Person2#: Sure. Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality.\n#Person1#: As far as you could see, is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland?\n#Person2#: To begin with, I have to use chopsticks.\n#Person1#: But you look quite proficient in using them now.\n#Person2#: Certainly. After all, I've been here for two years. It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils. Though, I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese table.\n#Person1#: Yes, table etiquette. There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told. Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners, while they are the norm in China. Hey! Your chopsticks, old silly! You should never stab your chopsticks into the rice bowl!\n#Person2#: Anything wrong with that?\n#Person1#: Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate. They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices for the death. It's very inauspicious, and might enrage all present.\n#Person2#: Oh, sorry! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks.",

In these kind of things, the trouble doesn't always appear at first.\n#Person2#: But everything has been so easy.\n#Person1#: Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned! That may be true, but if you were to do it, you would have trouble on the horizon. You always say that.\n#Person2#: Yeah, you never look at the positive side of things.\n#Person1#: Okay.

I have heard the police will be standing by with tear gas.\n#Person1#: Yes, but North Korea boasts it has nuclear arms.\n#Person2#: One hundred ninety countries have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but the issues are just too complex. There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.\n#Person1#: Several demonstrations have changed politician's minds throughout history. As a responsible citizen I think it is important to stand up for what you believe in.\n#Person2#: Leave it to someone else. As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right?\n#Person1#: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful. He advocates if you want world peace, peace begins at home-and that means right here in this city.\n#Person2#: You go if you want, Simon, but I plan to study for my physics exam.\n#Person1#: It would only take two hours of your day. The bus leaves the campus at 11:30 and leaves downtown to return to campus at 12:45. You could eat your lunch on the bus.\n#Person2#: I am not going, Simon. Why don't you ask the students in your political science class this afternoon if they want to go?\n#Person1#: They are all going.\n#Person2#: Okay, Simon. I need to meet my sister for coffee now.\n#Person1#: Bye then. See you in physics class tomorrow.",

She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you any more, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\n#Person2#: But Jason and Laura have been together for three years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\n#Person1#: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would, and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\n#Person2#: I'm not so sure about that.\n#Person1#: Let's try it my way, and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines.

You just enter your name, your birthday, your address, your bank information.\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: Your credit card number.\n#Person1#: Wait, wait, wait.\n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: I thought you said it was free.\n#Person2#: It IS free.\n#Person1#: Then, why do they need your bank and credit card information?\n#Person2#: Well, you know, it's just, you know, just ... just to check your identity or something like that. But, but it's all free. What?\n#Person1#: That doesn't sound free to me.\n#Person2#: Well, you don't understand.\n#Person1#: It sounds pretty fishy to me. How do you know that this is a trusted Web site. Look. That doesn't look like a secure URL.\n#Person2#: Well, you don't understand. Look. It says right here on their page. Right here: Our goal is help you learn. Trusting us. We knows how to help you in 15 days or below.\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: What the what?\n#Person1#: That's terrible English. Who wrote this? What country are they in? You need to help THEM with their English. I mean, this is a sure sign that they are trying to probably steal your personal information and your identify.\n#Person2#: No, no, no, and look. Here is a picture of some of their staff. And they look honest. Hey ...\n#Person1#: You're so gullible.\n#Person2#: Hey, hey. What are you doing?\n#Person1#: I'm shutting down your computer.

    "#Person1#: What are the main differences between this country and your country?\n#Person2#: Well, in Russia, everything happens very fast. People talk quickly, they drive their cars too fast, the good deals go by really quickly...but here in Canada, it seems like people are a little more relaxed.\n#Person1#: Is that true for everything?\n#Person2#: No, of course not. In Russia, going to the bank can take hours. The same is true for the post office and the supermarket. In Canada, however, these places are pretty easy to get through quickly.\n#Person1#: So, what is it that makes some things go either faster or slower compared to us here in Canada? I was born and raised here, so I guess I don't notice these things. I've also never been outside the country before.\n#Person2#: I think the people in Russia are fast movers by nature, at least in the big cities. Public places are still very slow because they haven't tried to do business any differently than they used to.\n#Person1#: But in Canada, it's the opposite?\n#Person2#: Right. The government here does a great job of solving problems and using new technology to make businesses work better. But I think Canadians are just more calm in general than Russians are... and they're definitely more relaxed than Americans!\n#Person1#: Well, I agree with you about that last part!",

That's no big deal. You know, Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture. Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter. Hmm, by the way, what do you do about tipping in China? \n#Person1#: We don't . \n#Person2#: No tipping? Now that's what I call a civilized system. \n#Person1#: At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill, but other than that , tipping isn't customary. \n#Person2#: What about cab drivers and porters? \n#Person1#: In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter. I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag, but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities. \n#Person2#: You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here.

My name is Johnson.\n#Person1#: Nice to meet you.\n#Person2#: Do you have any experience using weights?\n#Person1#: No, I don't. So I need some help.\n#Person2#: Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch. You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines.\n#Person1#: Yes, I know that. Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room. So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines.\n#Person2#: Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you.\n#Person1#: What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one.\n#Person2#: No. Not that. I mean a training card. The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine. Here, let me show you.\n#Person1#: I'm ready.\n#Person2#: Now, you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed. So, when you go through the series of twelve machines, you enter in the number of repetitions you do. And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine.\n#Person1#: I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress.\n#Person2#: Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine. Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them. And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you.\n#Person1#: Alright. Great.\n#Person2#: So you write your name and member number at the top of the card. And then, after you exercise each time, you file the card here.\n#Person1#: Great. Why don't we start on the machines?\n#Person2#: Are you alright? Can you do more?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted.\n#Person2#: That's okay. Don't worry. It's important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning.\n#Person1#: What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines.\n#Person2#: We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really. The most important thing is to know your limits. So if you feel burned out now, it is good to stop. Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right?\n#Person1#: Yes. I suppose it's best to stop.",

I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store.\n#Person2#: Where exactly did you use your passport in the store?\n#Person1#: In the shoe department. I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques.\n#Person2#: Well, let me call the shoe department to see if they'Ve found a passport. Sorry, your passport hasn't turned up there either.\n#Person1#: Then what shall I do?\n#Person2#: You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it. These kinds of things usually turn up eventually, but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation, so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up.\n#Person1#: You are right.

They didn't even ask me to give the ID.\n#Person2#: You have to be careful. If you lose them and someone finds them, the bank will charge you for what you buy.\n#Person1#: How much has the bank allowed us to spend with the card?\n#Person2#: Fifteen hundred dollars.

    "#Person1#: OK, that's a cut. Let's start from the beginning everyone.\n#Person2#: What was the problem that time?\n#Person1#: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you anymore, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\n#Person2#: But Jason and Laura had been together for 3 years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\n#Person1#: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\n#Person2#: I'm not so sure about that.\n#Person1#: Let's try it my way and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right we can try something else.",
    "#Person1#: Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. \n#Person2#: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. \n#Person1#: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \n#Person2#: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \n#Person1#: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \n#Person2#: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \n#Person1#: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \n#Person2#: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \n#Person1#: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \n#Person2#: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation. \n#Person1#: Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later! ",
    "#Person1#: Hey, How's it going? \n#Person2#: Not good. I lost my backpack.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's too bad. Is anything important in it?\n#Person2#: Just my wallet.

I left because I wanted to apply for a position in the Sales Department. That's where I work now.",
    "#Person1#: You look terrible, did you have a car accident?\n#Person2#: Well, not exactly. This morning I went to deliver milk, and the garden gate of No. 12 was locked. There was a note on the door of the house, and I thought I couldn't read it from where I was.\n#Person1#: What happened next?\n#Person2#: I jumped over the fence and went towards the door. And suddenly, as I was trying to read that note, a huge dog rushed at me. I started running as fast as I could, but I didn't see that...\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: The big branch of the tree near the garden gate. I knocked into it.\n#Person1#: What about the dog?\n#Person2#: Thank God, it didn't jump over the fence, but stayed in the garden barking loudly.\n#Person1#: It reminds me of a movie. A dog running after someone and...\n#Person2#: Stop it, Mary. It isn't that funny.",
    "#Person1#: Hi, Monica, congratulations! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech. And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project. You really made a big contribution to our company.\n#Person2#: Thank you, I just tried my best. I am very happy to know you like it.\n#Person1#: You must have been prepared for a long time. Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find, right?\n#Person2#: Well, yes. Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that. They are very supportive. I consulted an economic expert last week. He was very kind to give valuable suggestions.\n#Person1#: Now, the effort pays off. You have accomplished something.\n#Person2#: Come on, don't flatter me anymore. I took the job because I love being challenged. But I can't get this turned around without the support from you people.",
    "#Person1#: John dates her seven times a week.\n#Person2#: Really? That's a straws in the wind.\n#Person1#: I think so. Maybe he's fallen for her.\n#Person2#: Yeah. They suit each other. A perfect match between a man and a girl.",
    "#Person1#: Stand back from the door, please. Let the passengers off. You can't get on until the other passengers get off.\n#Person2#: How much is the fare, please?\n#Person1#: One dollar. Drop it in the box. Move to the rear of the bus. There are plenty of seats in the rear.\n#Person2#: Wait. I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village.\n#Person1#: That's right. Move along, please. There are more people waiting to get on. Move to the rear.\n#Person2#: I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue.\n#Person1#: No, that's the number l that goes down Park Avenue. This is the number 2.\n#Person2#: But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park.\n#Person1#: It is. Get in. please. You're holding everyone up. You can't miss Washington Square Park.\n#Person2#: Would you tell me when we get there?\n#Person1#: It would be better if you watched out for yourself. I might forget.",
    "#Person1#: Can you develop the roll of film?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: How long does it take?\n#Person2#: 6 hours. If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours.\n#Person1#: There is no need. I will come back tomorrow."
