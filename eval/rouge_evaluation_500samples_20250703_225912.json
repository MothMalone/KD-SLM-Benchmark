    "#Person1#: I think spring is finally here.\n#Person2#: Yep, it sure seems like it. However, it's still very cold at night.\n#Person1#: Yes, they turned the heat off 6 days ago. It's absolutely freezing in my apartment at night. I have to turn on the air conditioner to blow hot air in order to warm things up a little.\n#Person2#: Well, and if you are outside and is a bit of a breeze. It feels cold quickly.\n#Person1#: It sure does. I think I'm going to follow my cats example and just sit in the sum that shining in through the windows.",
    "#Person1#: Good morning, Mr. Smith. I've just come to tell you about the visit to a village planned for tomorrow. We have a choice of two villages. One is in the suburbs of Beijing, about 50 kilometers away. The other is in a rather out-of-the-way mountain area about 100 kilometers away. It's a small village that has recently made remarkable economic progress. It used to be very backward, but now the place has completely changed. Could you let me know which you'd prefer sometime this morning so that we can make the necessary arrangements?\n#Person2#: Well, I think I'd rather visit the village in the mountains.\n#Person1#: All right. In that case, I'm afraid we'll have to get up rather early tomorrow because it's quite far. We'll have lunch at the village and get back before supper. Suppose we get up at six, what do you say?\n#Person2#: That's fine.",
    "#Person1#: I have been washing the dishes for over a week now.\n#Person2#: Well, I think you are very good at doing the dishes, so maybe you should do them for another week.\n#Person1#: No. We made an agreement that we would take turns doing the dishes.

    "#Person1#: do you have any plans for dinner tonight?\n#Person2#: no, I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something. How about you?\n#Person1#: I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight. What do you think?\n#Person2#: I'm absolutely useless at cooking!\n#Person1#: I could teach you how to cook something healthy. Frozen pizza are so bad for you!\n#Person2#: I know they aren't good for me, but they are cheap, convenient, and fairly tasty.\n#Person1#: I recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize. Maybe we could try that?\n#Person2#: yeah, why not. Do you have all the ingredients?\n#Person1#: I bought all the ingredients this morning, so let's start!\n#Person2#: what do we do first?\n#Person1#: first, you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces.\n#Person2#: ok. Should I heat the wok?\n#Person1#: yes. Once it gets hot, put a little oil in it, add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes.\n#Person2#: what about the chicken?\n#Person1#: that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through.\n#Person2#: how about the rice?\n#Person1#: I'll prepare it. Do you prefer white rice or brown rice?\n#Person2#: white rice, please. None of that healthy brown stuff for me!",
    "#Person1#: Are you an art aficionado?\n#Person2#: Not really. I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year. I hardly know anything about art or sculpture. You are a true art lover, aren't you?\n#Person1#: I love going to art galleries, particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art.\n#Person2#: I never understand the meaning of those painting. They are too abstract for me. I didn't pay much attention in art class at school.\n#Person1#: Art isn't for everyone. I'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery. It's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture.\n#Person2#: I like sculpture, especially that form ancient rome or Greece. What time are you thinking of going? I'd love to go with you.\n#Person1#: I thought I'd have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards. Does that sound ok to you? Bus 51 goes directly there.\n#Person2#: That sounds fine. What time shall we meet at the bus stop?\n#Person1#: Let's meet at 12:30. it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits.",
    "#Person1#: Hello. Tenants Advocacy Resource Center.\n#Person2#: Hello. I'm having a problem with my house owner. The House owner is a nice enough guy, but he and I just can't seem to agree on repair costs.\n#Person1#: Has he been unwilling to make repairs?\n#Person2#: It's not that he's unwilling. He just takes too long. When I first moved in, the heater was broken and it took him 3 months to fix it and last month was my thirtieth birthday. My friends threw me a surprise party. They showed up with a ton of food and lots of beers and they even had a rock and roll band. It turned into an all night party and.\n#Person1#: And your neighbors started complaining about the noise.\n#Person2#: No, everyone in the building was there. It was a great party. Unfortunately, some people accidentally broke the living room window. Next day, I gotta repair person to come over to fix the window. Since he was already here, I had him fix the broken washing machine, which I had been complaining to the house owner about for over 2 months. Then last week, I mailed the money for the house, not including the repair costs. But this morning, my house owner called me angrily and said that he wouldn't pay for the repairs. That doesn't seem fair. What should I do?",

It does sound pretty serious. But I'm sure you can work this out.\n#Person1#: Well, you are over at the law school. So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms. Connors.

But you've arrived late several times. Since I've spoken to you about this, you have improved.\n#Person2#: I've been trying. I was only late once last month.\n#Person1#: That's good. One more thing, Katie, when you don't have a customer, you're always standing there daydreaming. If I ask you to do something, you're always willing. But when you don't have customers, I expect you to polish the jewelry and the mirrors, put new paper in the cash register, restock the boxes and do other things without being asked.\n#Person2#: OK.",

Did you say you never wash clothes before?\n#Person1#: Yes, never.\n#Person2#: I can't believe it.

American children are more independent. But in my country, the mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school, so she does everything for the kids.\n#Person2#: Then how are you going to survive on the campus?\n#Person1#: I don't know.

The bus was starting to smell toward the end of it and there was a guy next to me, he was breathing really loudly while he was sleeping. But the reason I took the passwords because it's more environmentally friendly than flying.\n#Person1#: I think it's great that you want to help the environment, but you look so exhausted right now.

If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there.\n#Person1#: You mean the line over there of about 200 people? !\n#Person2#: That's the one. It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight.\n#Person1#: This is a rotten way to start a vacation. I HATE lines! Can you book me on tomorrow's flight?\n#Person2#: Certainly. You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience.",
    "#Person1#: When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick, my heart was almost in my mouth.\n#Person2#: You were scared, too? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that. I almost got fainted.\n#Person1#: I could not and can't make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick. He plays the field with many girls.\n#Person2#: But Sarah says she does not care, so long as he loves her.",
    "#Person1#: Mary, why are you so tired?\n#Person2#: I go to the personnel market every day, and put a lot of energy into it.\n#Person1#: Why don't you think about applying for a job on the Internet?\n#Person2#: On the Internet? I have never tried that way.\n#Person1#: Well, it's very convenient and very popular now.\n#Person2#: So how to apply for a job on the Internet?\n#Person1#: Just get online and send your application through email to the employer.\n#Person2#: But how can I know which employer is hiring?\n#Person1#: You could place your job hunting information on the Job Wanted channel on a recruitment website.\n#Person2#: Will the employers see my information?\n#Person1#: Yes. If they think you are a fit, maybe they will contact you.\n#Person2#: Is it safe to job hunt on the Internet?\n#Person1#: If you log in some formal websites, it must be very safe.\n#Person2#: I will give it a try at once.",
    "#Person1#: OK, that's a cut. Let's start from the beginning everyone.\n#Person2#: What was the problem that time?\n#Person1#: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you anymore, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\n#Person2#: But Jason and Laura had been together for 3 years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\n#Person1#: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\n#Person2#: I'm not so sure about that.\n#Person1#: Let's try it my way and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right we can try something else.",

Your company is draining the life out of you!\n#Person2#: I know, but I don't have a choice, my boss has complete control over our work schedules. I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week.\n#Person1#: Well, I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work. . .\n#Person2#: No, not exactly, I'm working for minimum wage. And they don't give extra pay for overtime. Overtime is our own time.\n#Person1#: What? ! Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights! If you are putting in so many hours, they should give you some kind of compensation.\n#Person2#: They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers, but frankly, it's not much of an incentive. They give us a bonus of ten dollars.\n#Person1#: That's just wrong! why don't you just quit?\n#Person2#: I would, but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job.

You haven't missed any classes.\n#Person1#: To be honest, I work in supermarket from 7 to 10 o'clock every evening.\n#Person2#: I see. So you're pretty tired when you come to class.\n#Person1#: That's exactly why I want to borrow your notes. My notes aren't very good.\n#Person2#: So what do you usually do in class?\n#Person1#: I'm always awake at the beginning, but thirty minutes after class begins I feel sleepy and have trouble keeping my eyes open.\n#Person2#: Well, I need someone to study with and you need someone to keep you awake. Can we be study partners?\n#Person1#: Oh sure. That's a good idea. So give me a push when you see me sleeping in class.\n#Person2#: OK. Let's start today in the library.

Were you trying to use this machine here? \n#Person2#: Yeah! I just started my training today and I'm not really sure where to begin. \n#Person1#: It's ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition? \n#Person2#: Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and cardio. \n#Person1#: In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be enough. Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle. \n#Person2#: Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting?

Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world.\n#Person1#: The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, most countries are tiny.\n#Person2#: I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall.\n#Person1#: Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon.\n#Person2#: The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate.\n#Person1#: It's all so interesting. I'll have to find more information about it on the internet. Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class.",

I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs. \n#Person2#: Why do you say that? \n#Person1#: The city is beautiful, the off . . . , the offices are modern and comfortable, and the work is so interesting. \n#Person2#: Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives. Government service can be a rewarding and secure career. \n#Person1#: Do you mean financially rewarding? \n#Person2#: Well, many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries. \n#Person1#: I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy. \n#Person2#: Sometimes that's true, but not usually. Most feds are honest, hard-working professionals. It's hard to keep highly trained people, so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive. \n#Person1#: How much do you make? \n#Person2#: I'm a GS-15. That's high on the scale of workers, but even a GS-1 is paid a living wage. ",
    "#Person1#: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.\n#Person2#: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\n#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?\n#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\n#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\n#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.\n#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\n#Person2#: Fifty meters.\n#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\n#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n#Person2#: No, not at this stage.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.",

He seems like such an honest guy.\n#Person2#: That's what I thought. It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months.\n#Person1#: Two months? How did you find out?\n#Person2#: I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, and I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately.\n#Person1#: So you asked him about the girl who called?\n#Person2#: Yeah, he first said it was someone from work. He gave me a lame excuse, and so I pressed him on it.\n#Person1#: What'd he do?\n#Person2#: He kept trying to make stupid excuses, and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion.\n#Person1#: Indiscretion? How can an indiscretion last two months? I mean, you two have been married for two years! How can he do that to you?\n#Person2#: I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn't tell me the truth or end the relationship with her.\n#Person1#: Good. I totally agree with what you did.",

Man, I could tell from the moment I saw her, she's the girl of my dreams!\n#Person1#: So I take it you two are hitting it off? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor, but what if you break up?\n#Person2#: I don't know. I am not really worried about that. I don't wanna lose before even starting. Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her.\n#Person1#: Sounds like you've got some competition. You made a move already?\n#Person2#: Not yet. But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime. I know some good restaurants nearby.\n#Person1#: That's nice.

I found it is so close to our life.\n#Person1#: it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world.\n#Person2#: you said it. You know, the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years.\n#Person1#: well, it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too.\n#Person2#: I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married.\n#Person1#: oh, that's too short-lived.\n#Person2#: that's true. It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation.\n#Person1#: I can't agree more. The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage.\n#Person2#: definitely. They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously.\n#Person1#: in their mind, love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone.\n#Person2#: I think, as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste, it is the same thing with marriage.",

You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something.\n#Person2#: cool down, Harry! What are you really mad about? Did you get ripped off?\n#Person1#: yes. Last Sunday I went to a nearby market. It was on open-air fair. I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot, without even trying to strike a bargain. I paid one hundred and twenty. And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced. I could have talked my way to thirty.\n#Person2#: is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals. It's the norm of free trade. The seller sets a preposterous price, and the buyer tries his best to bring it down, until a compromise is reached. Yet you ignored the process. No wonder you ended up easy prey.\n#Person1#: but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?\n#Person2#: of course, that's something really irritating. And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first. And then you may negotiate for a fair deal.",

The team has about 10 officers who give tourist information directly over the counter to visitors. We speak a total of 13 languages altogether.\n#Person1#: That's pretty cool. So what exactly do you do everyday?\n#Person2#: Well, we act as a one stop shop for anyone who wants to come in. So it could be that they want a day trip from London, which is a very popular request. And we can offer suggestions of where to go and how to get there. If people want a two week tour of Britain, we can plan out exactly where to visit, what roads to take.\n#Person1#: So, do you have any suggestions for people coming to Britain?\n#Person2#: A good suggestion is to see as much as you can. But try to come back again and again to see different parts of the country, because in that way you really experience it.",

People don't live to a hundred and fifty. \n#Person1#: Oh, we are the part on the edge of middle. That's all. \n#Person2#: Oh, you know, we are not middle-aged.

Maybe she likes you.\n#Person1#: Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out.\n#Person2#: What're you so afraid of? Just tell her what you're feeling about her.\n#Person1#: I'd totally die if she turned me down.\n#Person2#: But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You've got to let her know. Come on! You've got to take a chance! Even though you are rejected, it's not the end of the world! There's nothing to lose, is there?\n#Person1#: I don't know. . .

First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly?\n#Person1#: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30.\n#Person2#: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand?\n#Person1#: Yes, yes. Oh, and drinks and snacks at the end.\n#Person2#: Better to have buffet lunch?\n#Person1#: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday.\n#Person2#: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February.\n#Person1#: Oh, that'll be fine.\n#Person2#: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.\n#Person1#: Free, fine, yes.\n#Person2#: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?\n#Person1#: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?\n#Person2#: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?\n#Person1#: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.\n#Person2#: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal.\n#Person1#: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before.\n#Person2#: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday?\n#Person1#: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations...\n#Person2#: 100?!\n#Person1#: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people.\n#Person2#: Yes, but the room won't...\n#Person1#: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.\n#Person2#: But what if they do? This room is the only one we have that day--there's a wedding reception in the banqueting rooms, so we...\n#Person1#: Well, in that case, I suppose...",

For example, head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations. This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly.\n#Person2#: That is wonderful. We've been having serious problems in that area.

But do you mean the province of Quebec or Quebec City?\n#Person1#: I mean the province. My friend's wedding is in Montreal, so I'm going there first. I'll stay for 5 days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province?\n#Person2#: Well, many people think so because it's the biggest city, but it's not the capital. Quebec City is, but Montreal is great. The Santa Lawrence River runs right through the middle of the city. It's beautiful in summer.\n#Person1#: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is okay, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?\n#Person2#: Well, people speak both French and English there, but you'll hear French most of the time and all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world. So you'd better practice your French before you go.\n#Person1#: Good advice, what about Quebec City? I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like?\n#Person2#: It's a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored.

You say it works?\n#Person2#: Yes. I did the program on the flight to the States. And when I arrived in New York, I didn't have any problem. No jet leg at all.

It really made a lot of difference.\n#Person1#: Hmm...So, what did you do?\n#Person2#: Well, I didn't drink any alcohol or coffee and I didn't eat any meat or rich food.

I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.\n#Person1#: Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how old are you?\n#Person2#: Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?\n#Person1#: Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!\n#Person2#: Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, and what about yourself?\n#Person1#: I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.

    "#Person1#: You look terrible, did you have a car accident?\n#Person2#: Well, not exactly. This morning I went to deliver milk, and the garden gate of No. 12 was locked. There was a note on the door of the house, and I thought I couldn't read it from where I was.\n#Person1#: What happened next?\n#Person2#: I jumped over the fence and went towards the door. And suddenly, as I was trying to read that note, a huge dog rushed at me. I started running as fast as I could, but I didn't see that...\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: The big branch of the tree near the garden gate. I knocked into it.\n#Person1#: What about the dog?\n#Person2#: Thank God, it didn't jump over the fence, but stayed in the garden barking loudly.\n#Person1#: It reminds me of a movie. A dog running after someone and...\n#Person2#: Stop it, Mary. It isn't that funny.",

How about you?\n#Person1#: I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight.

Should I heat the wok?\n#Person1#: yes. Once it gets hot, put a little oil in it, add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes.\n#Person2#: what about the chicken?\n#Person1#: that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through.\n#Person2#: how about the rice?\n#Person1#: I'll prepare it.

That's my favorite subject.\n#Person2#: That's because you always find it so easy. I find it very difficult so I don't like it much.\n#Person1#: Nancy finds English quite difficult too. But she says it's her favorite subject.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know, and her second favorite subject is math.\n#Person1#: Math is my worst. I don't like it.

You are a true art lover, aren't you?\n#Person1#: I love going to art galleries, particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art.\n#Person2#: I never understand the meaning of those painting. They are too abstract for me. I didn't pay much attention in art class at school.\n#Person1#: Art isn't for everyone. I'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery. It's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture.\n#Person2#: I like sculpture, especially that form ancient rome or Greece. What time are you thinking of going?

Fast food is so popular in this district.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: Anyway, how was your such, Catherine?\n#Person1#: It was good. I brough lunch from home today.\n#Person2#: You did? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America.\n#Person1#: Well, I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy.\n#Person2#: I guess you're right. More often than not, people go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, but generally speaking, they are high in calories, salt and fat.\n#Person1#: Yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle, don't you?\n#Person2#: You bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America.\n#Person1#: Well, actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places.\n#Person2#: Seriously?\n#Person1#: Yeah, it's hard to believe but true.",

We started to buy all kinds of records, soon, I found that I was buying more country music records than any other kind.\n#Person1#: How did you start working for the radio station?\n#Person2#: I thought there should be a radio program of country songs, so I went to CBC, and suggested it. That was how we started the program called Golden Country Time.\n#Person1#: Then you were asked to write articles to explain the background of those songs.\n#Person2#: Yes, but soon I got tired of running to the library to find information. So I started buying country song books and building my own library.",

It really made a lot of difference.\n#Person1#: Hmm...So, what did you do?\n#Person2#: Well, I didn't drink any alcohol or coffee and I didn't eat any meat or rich food.

That took almost two weeks.\n#Person1#: What kind of documents did you need to present?\n#Person2#: I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education, because I want a student visa.\n#Person1#: Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected?\n#Person2#: I think that they don't complete the forms correctly or they don't include all the required documents. The embassy is very strict about it. You have to be quite careful.\n#Person1#: Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities?\n#Person2#: That's simple. Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions.",

Instead, they just kept arguing with each other.\n#Person1#: Who was chairing the meeting?\n#Person2#: Bob.\n#Person1#: Well, I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes.\n#Person2#: That's exactly what happened!

Then he expected everyone to agree with him.\n#Person1#: What was the meeting about?\n#Person2#: We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient.\n#Person1#: It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient.\n#Person2#: Exactly. I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share, but they just wouldn't let me finish. What should I have done to get my point across?\n#Person1#: You have to keep things short and sweet. When you get a chance to speak, try not to get into too many unnecessary details.\n#Person2#: Short and sweet? But what if I have to explain something complicated?\n#Person1#: You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting.

Look at my running shoes over there.\n#Person1#: Andrew. They're still in the box. \n#Person2#: Well ... \n#Person1#: Never used. Besides exercise, yeah, exercise is wonderful. It's great, but you also need to learn how to eat right. For example, you need to eat smaller portions. And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties.\n#Person2#: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate!\n#Person1#: Andrew! That won't help. Next \n#Person2#: Oh, next? \n#Person1#: . Oh yeah. So, first of all, smaller portions \n#Person2#: Okay.\n#Person1#: Then, you need to make sure you eat a good, well-balanced breakfast first thing in the morning \n#Person2#: I do that. \n#Person1#: And then you follow that up with smaller meals throughout the day, cause, you know what? If you skip breakfast, then throughout the day, you feel like you need to make up it by overeating at lunch and dinner and lots of snacks.\n#Person2#: Uh ... \n#Person1#: Anyway, um, oh yeah. Don't eat late at night.\n#Person2#:  What? Like what?\n#Person1#:  Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat. You have to throw away ... Oh my gosh!\n#Person2#:  What?\n#Person1#: That's all you have in your freezer! You've only got ice cream in here! You're going to have to throw that all away?\n#Person2#: It's low-calorie ice cream.\n#Person1#: Low cal. No, it's not low-cal. Look right here. Andrew! That's all the food you've got in here is ice cream.\n#Person2#: Well, what else, what else?\n#Person1#: Also, what else are you eating? \n#Person2#: Well, you know ...\n#Person1#: I mean, seriously. All you eat is ice cream? Oh, oh, oh. Look in your trash. You go to McDonalds every day. Every day you're eating at fast food? \n#Person2#: Well ...\n#Person1#: Okay, you got to cut out the fast food. When you know the manger of McDonalds by name, and he's your best buddy on Facebook, you know that you're going to McDonalds or any fast food place too much.\n#Person2#: Uh, this is going to be tough.\n#Person1#: Yeah. It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. \n#Person2#:  Oh, well. \n#Person1#: cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day.\n#Person2#: I don't drink five gallons.\n#Person1#: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups!

Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world. \n#Person1#: That's why many people died in the earthquake. \n#Person2#: Well, China is located on the Eurasia plate, where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other. \n#Person1#: Oh, China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history. \n#Person2#: Yeah, we've experienced the 8. 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchuan. \n#Person1#: We're all familiar with natural disasters. but we still feel weak when we face Wenchuan earthquake. \n#Person2#: Right. But people at that time only know two words, 'save' and 'assistance', they will never don't lift a finger. Life is the most important compared with anything else. \n#Person1#: That's the point.

    "#Person1#: Tim, you're going to talk about your project and how to lead a greener life. Why did you choose that subject?\n#Person2#: Well. We'd learned a lot about the environment in our science lessons, so I decided to see what I could do in my own life rather than just act completely helpless. And I knew the rest of my family would be interested.\n#Person1#: Did you find it easy to get information?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I discovered there were lots of people at my age trying to be green. I'd always gone to school by car. Catching a bus would be better, but there's no bus where we live. So I've gone for riding my bike to school now.\n#Person1#: OK. And what about being green once you're actually at school?\n#Person2#: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper. We use huge quantities and I thought we should cut down and then it came to me that we should be sending in most of our work electronically. I'm going to recommend it to our teachers.\n#Person1#: And what about the school cafeteria?\n#Person2#: One school I've read about has meatless Mondays. It's good to use local produce, too. That something our school already does, but we still have machines with bottled milk, water and juices for sale. And I think we shouldn't have them.",

    "#Person1#: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.\n#Person2#: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\n#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?\n#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\n#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\n#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.\n#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\n#Person2#: Fifty meters.\n#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\n#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n#Person2#: No, not at this stage.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.",

There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there.\n#Person1#: Do you think that there is something magical about that place?\n#Person2#: Personally. I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them. I don't think place is magical in any way.",
    "#Person1#: Dad, you keep talking about family in New Zealand. Who are they?\n#Person2#: Well, that's your uncle Bill, his wife and two of their daughters.\n#Person1#: Is uncle Bill your brother?\n#Person2#: No, your uncle Jack is my brother, Bill is my brother-in-law, your mom's brother.\n#Person1#: So his two daughters are my cousins?\n#Person2#: That's right, Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters.\n#Person1#: What are step-sisters?\n#Person2#: Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter. When she was young, Bill's first wife, Sarah's mom died. Three years later Bill married again.\n#Person1#: So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother. Right?\n#Person2#: Yes. She is Sarah's step-mother.\n#Person1#: And when are they coming to visit us?\n#Person2#: They want to travel to Europe next year, and will visit us at the same Ae.",
    "#Person1#: John? It's Susan Miller.\n#Person2#: Hi, Susan. What's up?\n#Person1#: Do you know where that memo about office procedures is? I want to give my secretary a copy.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. I have no idea. I haven't seen that for ages.\n#Person1#: Alright. Thank you anyway.",

    "#Person1#: Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch. They have good cheese burgers.\n#Person2#: OK. I am hungry, too. I like their milkshake. They're very creamy and tasty.\n#Person1#: Look at the long line, there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger. It must be very delicious.\n#Person2#: Yup. But, this also means we have to wait to order our food.\n#Person1#: Come on. It is worth waiting. Their cheese burgers are really popular. Once you have it, you will love it.\n#Person2#: Well, sounds very attractive. I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time, and it was really delicious.\n#Person1#: Yup, they have good French fries as well. Not very thick, but crispy enough. You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce. That is the Belgium style. You will love it.\n#Person2#: OK, I think I know what to order for my lunch now. But, eating too much fried food really makes me fat.\n#Person1#: Come on. You just have it once in a while, not every day. It will not harm you.\n#Person2#: That's true. You can hear my tummy grumbling. I am really hungry!\n#Person1#: Be patient. Good food never comes fast.\n#Person2#: Ok!",
    "#Person1#: OK, that's a cut. Let's start from the beginning everyone.\n#Person2#: What was the problem that time?\n#Person1#: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you anymore, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\n#Person2#: But Jason and Laura had been together for 3 years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\n#Person1#: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\n#Person2#: I'm not so sure about that.\n#Person1#: Let's try it my way and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right we can try something else.",
    "#Person1#: Say, Jim, how about going for a few beers after dinner?\n#Person2#: You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness.\n#Person1#: What do you mean? It will help us to relax.\n#Person2#: Do you really think so? I don't. It will just make us fat and act silly. Remember last time?\n#Person1#: I guess you are right. But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.\n#Person2#: I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.\n#Person1#: That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.\n#Person2#: Sounds great to me! If they are willing, we could ask them to go dancing with us. That is excellent exercise and fun, too.\n#Person1#: Good. Let's go now.\n#Person2#: All right.",
    "#Person1#: Hi, can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. We have a reservation.\n#Person1#: What's your name, Sir?\n#Person2#: Jack.\n#Person1#: Yes Sir. We have your reservation.

I felt dizzy this morning.\n#Person2#: You should've called in sick! Next time, have either of your parents call the school office.",
    "#Person1#: Hi. I want to get something nice for my niece.\n#Person2#: Well, I've never heard of a little girl that didn't love Barbie dolls.\n#Person1#: I like that suggestion. Show me one, please.\n#Person2#: Here you go. Digital Barbie.\n#Person1#: Oh, my niece will love her! How much for her?\n#Person2#: Barbie is our best seller. She's only $ 29. 95.\n#Person1#: That's great. I'll take her.\n#Person2#: Your niece will love this. Anything else?\n#Person1#: Thank you, but no. This will do it for now.\n#Person2#: With the tax, your total is $ 32. 42. Would you like to charge it?\n#Person1#: I'll pay cash, thank you.\n#Person2#: Thank you for shopping here.",

I won't make a single noise.\n#Person2#: All right. Just five minutes. Be sure not to touch anything.\n#Person1#: Ok. I won't get into trouble.\n#Person2#: Be careful!\n#Person1#: Thanks for the warning, Mom.",
    "#Person1#: You're finally here! What took so long?\n#Person2#: I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.\n#Person1#: It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.\n#Person2#: I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.\n#Person1#: perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.\n#Person2#: I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.\n#Person1#: It would be better for the environment, too.\n#Person2#: I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.\n#Person1#: Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.\n#Person2#: The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.\n#Person1#: Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.\n#Person2#: That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!\n#Person1#: So, are you going to quit driving to work then?\n#Person2#: Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.",
    "#Person1#: Congratulations! Mr. Stuart! You won the city marathon.\n#Person2#: Thank you. I am very excited.\n#Person1#: We are all very proud of you.\n#Person2#: I am very happy, too.

    "#Person1#: I want to know how to buy something from this machine. \n#Person2#: Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy? \n#Person1#: I want to buy one of those snack things. \n#Person2#: Are you ready to go? \n#Person1#: I'm clear so far. \n#Person2#: The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in. \n#Person1#: It won't go in! \n#Person2#: Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work. \n#Person1#: Yes, next step. \n#Person2#: Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that reliable. \n#Person1#: They're totally unreliable. \n#Person2#: You seem to have it down. Have a good day! ",

    "#Person1#: I swear I will never shop at a street market in China. It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something.\n#Person2#: cool down, Harry! What are you really mad about? Did you get ripped off?\n#Person1#: yes. Last Sunday I went to a nearby market. It was on open-air fair. I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot, without even trying to strike a bargain. I paid one hundred and twenty. And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced. I could have talked my way to thirty.\n#Person2#: is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals. It's the norm of free trade. The seller sets a preposterous price, and the buyer tries his best to bring it down, until a compromise is reached. Yet you ignored the process. No wonder you ended up easy prey.\n#Person1#: but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?\n#Person2#: of course, that's something really irritating. And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first. And then you may negotiate for a fair deal.",
    "#Person1#: Hello?\n#Person2#: Good morning, Nathaniel. This is Leah calling from the International Student Office.\n#Person1#: Good morning.\n#Person2#: The reason I'm calling is because Ms. Collins will not be able to call you back until next week.\n#Person1#: Oh. I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday.\n#Person2#: She's terribly sorry about that. She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week. She hopes you understand.\n#Person1#: Is there someone else I can talk to?\n#Person2#: She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today. When are you free today?\n#Person1#: Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me.\n#Person2#: Mr. Liu is available at 2:15 today. Will that work for you?\n#Person1#: I'd prefer to speak with Ms. Fonda.\n#Person2#: I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon. She has an opening at 11:30 this morning.

    "#Person1#: Ted, where are you going for your holiday this year?\n#Person2#: I haven't decided yet. My wife is going to stay at her parents' for a few weeks. They live in the countryside, you know.\n#Person1#: Why not go with her? You can enjoy fresh air there.\n#Person2#: Well, to be honest, I don't like living with my wife's parents. So maybe I'll just stay at home. What about you?\n#Person1#: I'll spend a few weeks in China. My husband and I want to see around the country.\n#Person2#: China is a great country. There are many great places to visit there. I'm sure you'll have great fun.",
    "#Person1#: Good morning. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: Well, I hate to disturb you, but I really can't stand it any more. Can you change my room for me? It's too noisy. I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. It was too much for me.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry to hear that. This room is at the end of the corridor. It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when everything is quiet.\n#Person2#: Anyhow, I'd like to change my room.\n#Person1#: I'm awfully sorry, Miss. I do apologize. We'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. Could you wait till tomorrow? A tour company will be leaving tomorrow morning. There'll be some rooms for you to choose from.\n#Person2#: All right. I hope I'll be able to enjoy my stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep.\n#Person1#: Be sure.

It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first! \n#Person1#: Oh, your precious game. You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals! \n#Person2#: Oh no you didn't. You didn't just insult the Sals-bury Seals, did you?

    "#Person1#: Hey Sarah, are you all right? You look upset.\n#Person2#: As a matter of fact, I am a bit upset. I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well.\n#Person1#: What happened?\n#Person2#: No one would listen to any of my suggestions. Instead, they just kept arguing with each other.\n#Person1#: Who was chairing the meeting?\n#Person2#: Bob.\n#Person1#: Well, I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes.\n#Person2#: That's exactly what happened! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say. Then he expected everyone to agree with him.\n#Person1#: What was the meeting about?\n#Person2#: We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient.\n#Person1#: It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient.\n#Person2#: Exactly. I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share, but they just wouldn't let me finish. What should I have done to get my point across?\n#Person1#: You have to keep things short and sweet. When you get a chance to speak, try not to get into too many unnecessary details.\n#Person2#: Short and sweet? But what if I have to explain something complicated?\n#Person1#: You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting. Not everyone needs to know all that information.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea, I think I will try that at the next meeting.",

But this is the year of our 17-year bird calls.\n#Person1#: You mean it's only noisy right now for me and it won't be like this again until 2034?\n#Person2#: Well, it's not all summer long. They just come out when the weather gets cool, usually after a big storm. They'll be quiet after 4 or 5 weeks.\n#Person1#: Where do they go for the next 17 years?\n#Person2#: Oh, they live near the mountains for most of their lives. They just come down here to sing and do their special dances.\n#Person1#: Sounds like they're in the sky.\n#Person2#: Well, they're in the trees mostly.\n#Person1#: This is terrible. Now I don't want to walk under any of the trees in this forest. There's probably bird waste everywhere.\n#Person2#: So you don't have these in the city. I thought I heard them when I went to Atlanta Georgia.\n#Person1#: I've never heard anything like this before. California might not have them.\n#Person2#: Maybe they're just in the East.",

How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, it won't cost you much. It's only around $ 59. 95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America.\n#Person2#: Hey, How did you know I came from America?\n#Person1#: Just a hunch, sir.\n#Person2#: How much again?\n#Person1#: $ 59. 95.\n#Person2#: That's really cheap for shoes like those. OK, I'll take 5 pairs.\n#Person1#: Sorry, sir.\n#Person2#: Why not?\n#Person1#: Because in this duty-free shop, your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife.\n#Person2#: Oh, my God. I've totally forgotten about that. Anyway, I think she would like a bottle of perfume.\n#Person1#: That's good. And I can also recommend you a good one. It's the brand of DENY.\n#Person2#: DENY? That's very expensive in America. It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml. DKNY?\n#Person1#: It's $ 60 here.\n#Person2#: That's very unbelievable. Is it fake?\n#Person1#: Of course not, sir.\n#Person2#: OK, I'll take one.",

The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre. \n#Person1#: As the city grew, it must have absorbed many village nearby. \n#Person2#: Yes, it did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city. \n#Person1#: I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city? \n#Person2#: Oh, yes.

    "#Person1#: Are you going to the demonstration to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons tomorrow, Cleo?\n#Person2#: No, Simon. I hate demonstrations. I have heard the police will be standing by with tear gas.\n#Person1#: Yes, but North Korea boasts it has nuclear arms.\n#Person2#: One hundred ninety countries have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but the issues are just too complex. There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration.

As a responsible citizen I think it is important to stand up for what you believe in.\n#Person2#: Leave it to someone else. As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right?\n#Person1#: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful. He advocates if you want world peace, peace begins at home-and that means right here in this city.\n#Person2#: You go if you want, Simon, but I plan to study for my physics exam.\n#Person1#: It would only take two hours of your day.

I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.\n#Person1#: How do you know about classical music?\n#Person1#: Actually, I specialized in classical music for my master study. Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Researches suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better. That's true.

Do you think students should listen to more classical music than others and why?\n#Person1#: Yes. Sometimes students can be stressful. Listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.\n#Person2#: Okay, I think I've known enough of you. The interview is over.\n#Person1#: Thank you for your time.\n#Person2#: Oh, by the way. I think I may want to listen to some classical music. Do you have any suggestions?\n#Person1#: You can find plenty of recording on the internet. You can search and listen to different classical music and see which interests you the most. You can also buy them very cheaply online if you like them.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. I'll try it.",

    "#Person1#:  So is there any other area I should look at as well?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd recommend West Derby. That will be closer to your office.\n#Person1#:  That sounds good.\n#Person2#:  Yes, and if you have children, it also has very good schools.\n#Person1#:  That's not my concern. I live on my own so I'm only looking for a cheap single room, something like a flat.\n#Person2#:  Umm, that may be a problem here in this area then, because there are mostly larger houses here. You'd probably be able to share one with other people who want to rent though.\n#Person1#:  No, I'm only interested in flats at the moment.\n#Person2#:  We actually have another office in South Derby, and the guy who works there is a really good friend of mine. His name is John Godfrey.\n#Person1#:  Could you tell me his telephone number?\n#Person2#:  It's 074263951.\n#Person1#:  Great. Is there a good time to call him? I'm here for a whole week until Sunday tenth.\n#Person2#:  I'm sure he'll be able to see you on Saturday.\n#Person1#:  That sounds fine. Thanks for your help.",

Open it and check if there are any fuses blown out.\n#Person1#: How do I know if it's blown out?\n#Person2#: You'll see it's black and has burnt smell.\n#Person1#: Then what shall I do?\n#Person2#: Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones.

I wasn't as careless as John Sampson. He walked across that wet cement over there.\n#Person1#: The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a notice.\n#Person2#: The headmaster asked them not to do so.\n#Person1#: Then why isn't there a notice?\n#Person2#: They went to their stores to get one. Here they come with it now!\n#Person1#: But look at them! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice!",
    "#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, is there any vacant room for tomorrow?\n#Person1#: I am sorry. We are full up for tomorrow.\n#Person2#: Well, is there any other hotel nearby?\n#Person1#: Yes, the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away. Maybe you can ask them.\n#Person2#: Thank you.",

    "#Person1#: So, where are you going to spend your winter vacation? \n#Person2#: Oh, I'm going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand. \n#Person1#: You have a girlfriend in Thailand? Interesting. How come I have never heard of that? \n#Person2#: Actually it will be my first time to meet her. \n#Person1#: You mean you haven't seen her before? Then, how could she be your girlfriend?

We even plan to be engaged next month. \n#Person1#: Congratulations! It's good to follow your heart.

    "#Person1#: Have you ever thought of moving, Sarah?\n#Person2#: We thought about it, but my husband and I can't afford it right now.\n#Person1#: Buying a house near our company can be expensive, but there are ways to find cheaper houses.\n#Person2#: Like what?\n#Person1#: Well, you can buy a house far away from the city center. You would definitely save money that way.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea.\n#Person1#: My sister in law and her husband just bought a house that way. And they're pretty satisfied with it.\n#Person2#: Is the house in poor condition?\n#Person1#: Not at all, the woman who owned it bought it from her friend and took good care of it. But when she died she had no family left and no will, so the government had to sell it for her.\n#Person2#: Was it a very old house?\n#Person1#: Yes, it was about 50 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing but it didn't take a lot of money or time.\n#Person2#: Is it in a good location?\n#Person1#: The area can be a bit rough in the evening but the neighbors watch out for each other so it's OK.",

In these kind of things, the trouble doesn't always appear at first.\n#Person2#: But everything has been so easy.\n#Person1#: Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned!

I'm preparing for a geography class.\n#Person1#: There are no countries marked on the map.\n#Person2#: No, there aren't. this map just show the geographical features. Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world.\n#Person1#: The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, most countries are tiny.\n#Person2#: I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall.\n#Person1#: Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon.\n#Person2#: The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate.\n#Person1#: It's all so interesting. I'll have to find more information about it on the internet. Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class.",

Why do you need so much?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I want my clothes to be clean.\n#Person2#: But you can't use so much. The machines won't be able to remove the soap completely. On the contrary, too many bubbles trapped dirt, allowing bacteria to build up.\n#Person1#: Oh, I guess I didn't know. I have never washed close before.\n#Person2#: What? Did you say you never wash clothes before?\n#Person1#: Yes, never.\n#Person2#: I can't believe it. How can that be?\n#Person1#: My mother always did it.\n#Person2#: Yes, my mother washed my clothes, too. But when I was 12, I started to wash clothes myself.\n#Person1#: I know about this fact. American children are more independent. But in my country, the mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school, so she does everything for the kids.\n#Person2#: Then how are you going to survive on the campus?\n#Person1#: I don't know.

How are you feeling after that long bus ride?\n#Person2#: It wasn't too bad, it was only 19 hours.\n#Person1#: That's crazy. You could have flown here from London for 60 euros and it would have only taken an hour and a half. Was it really worth all that time just to save a bit of money.\n#Person2#: Well, it was a pretty uncomfortable right to be honest. The bus was starting to smell toward the end of it and there was a guy next to me, he was breathing really loudly while he was sleeping. But the reason I took the passwords because it's more environmentally friendly than flying.\n#Person1#: I think it's great that you want to help the environment, but you look so exhausted right now.

And I'm afraid it hasn't really matched up to what I was told about.\n#Person1#: I see, what exactly is the matter?\n#Person2#: Well, first of all, there is this large scratch across the front of it.\n#Person1#: But you should have noticed that when you bought it.\n#Person2#: But it was in the box and all sealed up.\n#Person1#: Well. I'm sorry, but it really is your responsibility to check the goods when you buy them. How are we to know that it wasn't you who made the scratch?\n#Person2#: But that's ridiculous.

Except magazines or journals, they have to be read within library.\n#Person1#: How long can I keep the books?\n#Person2#: For one month. If you can't return the books in time, you'll be fined.

The Santa Lawrence River runs right through the middle of the city. It's beautiful in summer.\n#Person1#: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is okay, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?\n#Person2#: Well, people speak both French and English there, but you'll hear French most of the time and all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world. So you'd better practice your French before you go.\n#Person1#: Good advice, what about Quebec City? I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like?\n#Person2#: It's a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored.

Open it and check if there are any fuses blown out.\n#Person1#: How do I know if it's blown out?\n#Person2#: You'll see it's black and has burnt smell.\n#Person1#: Then what shall I do?\n#Person2#: Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones.

    "#Person1#: I enjoy going through secondhand bookstores, don't you? It's interesting to see what people used to enjoy reading. Did you see this old book of children's stories?\n#Person2#: Some of these books aren't so old, though. See? This novel was published only six years ago. It costs seventy-five cents.\n#Person1#: Hey! Look at this!\n#Person2#: What? Are you getting interested in nineteenth-century plays all of a sudden?\n#Person1#: Well, look at the words. Someone gave this book as a present, and wrote a note on the inside of the front cover. It's dated 1893. Maybe it's worth something.\n#Person2#: Everything on that shelf is worth fifty cents.\n#Person1#: But if this is the signature of someone who is well-known, it might bring a lot more. I hear William Shakespeare's signature is worth about a million dollars.\n#Person2#: Oh? I can hardly read what that one says. Who wrote it?\n#Person1#: The name looks like 'Harold Dickson'. Wasn't he a politician or something? I'm going to buy this book and see if I can find a name looks like that in the library.\n#Person2#: Good luck. Your poetry book may make you rich, but I think my seventy-five-cent story is a better buy.",

In fact, I'm still not feeling well.\n#Person1#: Yes, I can see that. What was the problem?\n#Person2#: The doctor thinks it was food poisoning. I went to a nice restaurant for lunch with a few of my classmates last Sunday. It was a great meal. So many dishes, barbecued beef, roast mutton and lots of vegetables.\n#Person1#: Sounds delicious.\n#Person2#: Yeah, it was. But on my way home I got some fried chicken to eat from a street store. Not long after I got home I started feeling sick.\n#Person1#: Are you thinking that is what caused your illness?\n#Person2#: Well, it must have been. No one else who ate the lunch got sick. Anyway, I'm feeling a little better now.\n#Person1#: I'm glad to hear that, and are you able to keep up with all your lessons?\n#Person2#: Yes, my classmates have been bringing me their notebooks and I can download the biology lessons from the Internet.\n#Person1#: Oh yes, it is really a good idea.",

Hmm, by the way, what do you do about tipping in China? \n#Person1#: We don't . \n#Person2#: No tipping? Now that's what I call a civilized system. \n#Person1#: At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill, but other than that , tipping isn't customary. \n#Person2#: What about cab drivers and porters? \n#Person1#: In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter. I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag, but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities. \n#Person2#: You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here.

And what about being green once you're actually at school?\n#Person2#: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper. We use huge quantities and I thought we should cut down and then it came to me that we should be sending in most of our work electronically. I'm going to recommend it to our teachers.\n#Person1#: And what about the school cafeteria?\n#Person2#: One school I've read about has meatless Mondays. It's good to use local produce, too.

    "#Person1#: Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Lee. Here is his parcel.\n#Person2#: Oh, just put it on my desk. I need to sign here, right? Will you please wait for a second? I happened to have something to express.",
    "#Person1#: So that concludes the introduction. Now let's move to the first part of my talk, which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan. So first, right off the bat, When looking at the marketing plan, tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with...\n#Person2#: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...\n#Person1#: That's correct. If you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. Now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. First, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year. Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts. If you look at the overhead, you'll see a graph... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005, the red line is the sales in 2006... As you can see, our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with, but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year. On the other hand, you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket.",
    "#Person1#: Excuse me. I get confused that the two phones on the booth are different, can you tell me how to use them?\n#Person2#: Let me have a look. Oh, yes. This one is the IC phone and the other is the coin phone. If you have an IC card, you can insert it into this slot, wait for the dialing signal appearing on the small screen, and then dial the number of the person you are going to call.\n#Person1#: Well, I see. How to use the other one?\n#Person2#: First, you pick up the receiver, wait for the dialing signal, dial the number, and then put the coin into the slot, press the'speak'button. Then everything is done.\n#Person1#: It seems quite easy. I will try both of them.",
    "#Person1#: What are you working on?\n#Person2#: I'm figuring out my budget.\n#Person1#: What budget?\n#Person2#: I'm making a shopping budget, so that I don't spend too much money.\n#Person1#: How much money can you spend?\n#Person2#: I can only spend $ 300 a month.\n#Person1#: Why only $ 300?\n#Person2#: I need to save the rest.\n#Person1#: For what?\n#Person2#: I need to pay my bills.\n#Person1#: Your budget is a good idea.\n#Person2#: I know. It's going to save me a lot of money, I hope.",
    "#Person1#: Good evening. Welcome to our restaurant.\n#Person2#: Good evening. We want a dinning room with a table for eight.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, sir. The rooms are not available now. But would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall? I can find a table by the window for you.\n#Person2#: No, thanks. We have made a reservation before.\n#Person1#: Can I have your name, please?\n#Person2#: My name is James.\n#Person1#: I'll ask waitress to show you the way.\n#Person2#: Thanks.",

S.?\n#Person2#: 3 weeks.\n#Person1#: Is your wife with you?\n#Person2#: Yes, she just got here yesterday.\n#Person1#: Have you been to California before?\n#Person2#: No. I've never been there.\n#Person1#: Have you ever been to Las Vegas?\n#Person2#: Yes. I went there once on a business trip.",
    "#Person1#: What are you doing?\n#Person2#: I'm just looking at this map of the world. I'm preparing for a geography class.\n#Person1#: There are no countries marked on the map.\n#Person2#: No, there aren't. this map just show the geographical features. Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world.\n#Person1#: The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, most countries are tiny.\n#Person2#: I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall.\n#Person1#: Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon.\n#Person2#: The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate.\n#Person1#: It's all so interesting. I'll have to find more information about it on the internet. Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class.",
    "#Person1#: How meat? Shall we all go for a meal at the pizza experience this evening?\n#Person2#: We went to the pizza experience last Wednesday, didn't we?\n#Person1#: Yes, we did, and the time before that, why don't we go to the Steakhouse.\n#Person2#: But Bridget doesn't eat meat, does she?\n#Person1#: No, she doesn't. Well, what about the Kingfisher? She eats fish, doesn't she?\n#Person2#: Yes, she does, but Arthur doesn't.\n#Person1#: I know let's go to the Carrots.\n#Person2#: Oh yes, we've had lunch there a couple of times, haven't we?\n#Person1#: Yes, but I just remembered it isn't open on Thursday. Let's go tomorrow evening instead.",
    "#Person1#: Terrible. How about people's lives? \n#Person2#: Fortunately, there is no person died. \n#Person1#: That's great. It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake. \n#Person2#: Yeah. Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world. \n#Person1#: That's why many people died in the earthquake. \n#Person2#: Well, China is located on the Eurasia plate, where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other. \n#Person1#: Oh, China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history. \n#Person2#: Yeah, we've experienced the 8. 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchuan. \n#Person1#: We're all familiar with natural disasters. but we still feel weak when we face Wenchuan earthquake. \n#Person2#: Right. But people at that time only know two words, 'save' and 'assistance', they will never don't lift a finger. Life is the most important compared with anything else. \n#Person1#: That's the point. Love among human beings is not limited by geography. ",
    "#Person1#: Brian, do you know how to speak English?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Where did you learn?\n#Person2#: I learned in college.\n#Person1#: You speak really well.\n#Person2#: Thank you.\n#Person1#: How long have you been in the U.

I went there once on a business trip.",
    "#Person1#: Hi, do you know what's for dinner? I'm starving.\n#Person2#: We're on our own tonight, dad's taking mom out.\n#Person1#: Out? What do you mean out?\n#Person2#: You know on a date, they are going to dinner.\n#Person1#: Dad and mom?\n#Person2#: Yeah, they said they're reviving the old tradition.\n#Person1#: You mean this is going to be a regular thing?\n#Person2#: That's right, once a week. Do you want to order some pizza?",
    "#Person1#: Have you every belonged to a political party?\n#Person2#: No, I haven't, but I thought about joining the green party.\n#Person1#: Really? I know you are very concerned about the environment. You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace, weren't you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I was. But I didn't have enough time to devote to it.\n#Person1#: The green party have no chance of winning an election. The other parties are too big and popular.\n#Person2#: You're right. But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties. Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness\n#Person1#: Most people are not very politically aware. They often don't understand the issues fully.\n#Person2#: That's true. But it's a little strange because the media often reports on political events. You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv.",
    "#Person1#: Do you drink much?\n#Person2#: Depending on what you consider a lot.\n#Person1#: How frequently do you drink?\n#Person2#: Couple times a week.

So for ten, fifteen bucks, I can get a lot of drinks.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: If you don't like beer, have you tried mixed drinks? Some of them are pretty good.\n#Person1#: I like beer, it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3.\n#Person2#: You just have to build up a tolerance. I used to be like that. But your body gets used to it.\n#Person1#: It'll take awhile, but I'm working on it.\n#Person2#: Hey let's go out tomorrow night. The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers.\n#Person1#: Alright.",
    "#Person1#: I can't believe I still have this pain in my back. This medicine the doctor gave me was supposed to make me feel better by now.\n#Person2#: Maybe you should start taking it three times a day like you were told.",

    "#Person1#: What's the matter, Lisa? You don't look too good.\n#Person2#: I just found out that my husband is cheating on me.\n#Person1#: You mean Mark? He seems like such an honest guy.\n#Person2#: That's what I thought. It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months.\n#Person1#: Two months? How did you find out?\n#Person2#: I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, and I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately.\n#Person1#: So you asked him about the girl who called?\n#Person2#: Yeah, he first said it was someone from work. He gave me a lame excuse, and so I pressed him on it.\n#Person1#: What'd he do?\n#Person2#: He kept trying to make stupid excuses, and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion.\n#Person1#: Indiscretion? How can an indiscretion last two months? I mean, you two have been married for two years! How can he do that to you?\n#Person2#: I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn't tell me the truth or end the relationship with her.\n#Person1#: Good. I totally agree with what you did.",

    "#Person1#: Have you ever thought of moving, Sarah?\n#Person2#: We thought about it, but my husband and I can't afford it right now.\n#Person1#: Buying a house near our company can be expensive, but there are ways to find cheaper houses.\n#Person2#: Like what?\n#Person1#: Well, you can buy a house far away from the city center. You would definitely save money that way.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea.\n#Person1#: My sister in law and her husband just bought a house that way. And they're pretty satisfied with it.\n#Person2#: Is the house in poor condition?\n#Person1#: Not at all, the woman who owned it bought it from her friend and took good care of it. But when she died she had no family left and no will, so the government had to sell it for her.\n#Person2#: Was it a very old house?\n#Person1#: Yes, it was about 50 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing but it didn't take a lot of money or time.\n#Person2#: Is it in a good location?\n#Person1#: The area can be a bit rough in the evening but the neighbors watch out for each other so it's OK."
